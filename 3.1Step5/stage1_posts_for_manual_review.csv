Been digging deep into recruiting automation software lately, especially the “AI everything” wave. But most tools feel like vaporware or barely handle volume.

If you're processing dozens or hundreds of candidates/month, have you actually cut hiring costs or time-to-fill with AI tools? What’s been the ROI?

Tools I’m curious about:
- Interview AI
- screening AI
- AI interview scheduling
- ATS automation (we're using Bullhorn, so looking for something that integrates)

On one hand, the idea of saving time and getting warm intros to people who are actively looking and aligned with our stage sounds appealing. On the other hand, I’m skeptical about whether these tools actually deliver on quality or if it’s just a glorified sourcing bot with some clever packaging.

While interviewing, I came up with an idea to have an AI assistant that listens to both me and the candidate, helping me ask the right questions.

So I'm wondering, does anyone else experience similar issues? I have a tech background, so I'm considering creating an AI app that would simply sit on a phone, listen to the interview, interpret it, and proactively suggest what to ask next in real-time. I don't want any integration with dinosaur ATS systems etc., just a standalone app that listens and proactively assists. It could also generate summaries afterward, but that's secondary.

AI,humanresources,1nnlnw7,Need your opinion: Company wants AI to run first interviews and I’m uneasy about it [CO],"My company is seriously considering rolling out an AI interview tool to handle the first screening with candidates. The pitch is that it will shorten hiring time and make the process more efficient. Everyone around me seems excited about the idea… but I can’t shake the feeling that something important is being lost.

I keep putting myself in the candidate’s shoes. If I were applying for a job and my very first “conversation” was with a bot, I’d feel like I wasn’t valued as a person from the start. I believe that first interaction sets the tone, it’s where you get a sense of the company’s culture, the energy of the team, and the subtle cues that don’t show up in a resume. An algorithm can score answers, but it can’t build rapport, pick up on personality, or make someone feel welcome.

Leadership argues that AI will cut hiring time, but to me it risks sending the message that people are just data points. I know efficiency matters, but part of me believes hiring should stay human, even if it takes more time.

Am I being too moralistic here, or does anyone else feel uneasy about letting AI handle the very first conversation with a candidate?

AI,humanresources,123xx18,ChatGPT replacing ER Investigators,"Sr. ER Investigator here for big tech company. I’ve been in investigations more than a decade and am finishing my PhD in a related field. 

I’d like to hear from folks who are regularly utilizing ChatGPT already or have experience with AI tech. With the legal industry bracing for major impact (read: Goldman Sachs just predicted 44% of legal jobs will be made obsolete in the next few years), does anyone in HR think AI will do their job? 

For me it’s hard to imagine my company allowing AI to do sexual harassment and EEOC investigations. It’s not that AI can’t do them (it can! And probably better than 80%+ investigators), but that I can’t imagine asking someone who has been sexually assaulted at work to be interviewed by an AI and telling them an AI will do the investigation. 

Here’s ChatGPT on how AI will impact HR investigations: 

“AI is poised to have a significant impact on HR investigations in various ways. As technology continues to advance, AI-driven tools will play a more prominent role in streamlining and enhancing the investigation process. Some of the key ways AI can impact HR investigations include:

1. Enhanced objectivity: AI can help reduce bias and human error in investigations by providing an impartial analysis of the data. This objectivity can lead to more accurate findings and fairer outcomes.
2. Automating repetitive tasks: AI can automate time-consuming and repetitive tasks, such as document review, data collection, and preliminary analysis. This can allow HR investigators to focus on more strategic aspects of the investigation, such as interviewing witnesses and drawing conclusions.
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI-driven NLP tools can help analyze written and spoken communication, such as emails, chat transcripts, and recorded conversations. This can help identify instances of harassment, discrimination, or other inappropriate behavior that may be relevant to an investigation.
4. Sentiment analysis: AI can analyze employee sentiment in communication channels, such as emails and instant messages, to identify negative patterns that may indicate underlying issues or conflicts in the workplace.
Predictive analytics: AI can help organizations identify potential risks and take proactive measures to prevent incidents from occurring. By analyzing employee behavior patterns, AI can help flag employees who may be at risk of engaging in misconduct or violating policies.
Enhanced privacy and security: 5. AI-driven tools can help organizations manage sensitive information more securely, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to specific data during investigations.
6. Continuous monitoring and improvement: AI can provide ongoing monitoring and analysis of workplace data, allowing HR professionals to identify trends and areas for improvement. This can lead to more effective policy and procedure updates and the prevention of future issues.
7. Improved data analysis: AI can analyze large amounts of data quickly, identifying patterns, anomalies, or trends that may be relevant to an investigation. This can help HR professionals uncover crucial information, such as workplace issues, employee misconduct, or compliance violations.

While AI has the potential to greatly impact HR investigations, it is essential to remember that AI is a tool that should be used alongside human expertise. The technology can provide valuable insights and streamline processes, but human judgment and ethical considerations must still be a central part of the investigation process.”

As you can see, the impact will be quite data-driven as AI lacks human reasoning. I would love to hear thoughts from other ER folks on this…

AI,recruitinghell,1c5grrw,"Now being an HRM, I'll share my view from that side, plus some tips that could possibly help.","***Disclaimer:*** I was laid off last year as part of a 25% reduction. I applied to \~500 positions. Out of those 500, I interacted with about 25-30. Made it to the last round with \~5 or so, and got 1 offer which I rejected. Then an offer I accepted (but since then moved to a new gig). It took me 2.5 months total, and I spent 9am-6pm M-F on my search.

Now find myself in a position where I have to fill a few roles. We're a SaaS place, and applicants need to know cloud tech, basic programming, troubleshooting. Pay is in the 175-225k range.

I am working with a recruiter who crafted the JD, posted the openings, and is reviewing the responses. We received \~1000 applicants in the first 3 days.

**This is our hiring process:**

* 1st round: Filters! Yes, filters are real, but ours are not keyword filters. They are based on what you answer to questions asked during the application: Location, citizen/sponsorship, years experience with X, Y and Z?
* 2nd round: The filters knock out a lot, after which the recruiter reviews the remaining ones. Recruiter tells me there are a lot of obvious fake profiles and reports that he sees duplicates styled resumes with apparently AI is getting worse!
* 3rd round: Recruiter then identifies interesting profiles for me to check out. I get to say yay/nay on whether the recruiter should have a chat.
* 4rd round: Recruiter speaks with the candidate and checks vibe, comp, basics and does a write up. Rejects obvious frauds which there are a lot: e.g people who don't go on camera, delayed responses after keyboard clicking (chatgpt)
* 5th round: I check that write up and then decide if I want to speak with the candidate. This is not an automatic.. e.g if someone applied for the jr positions and has been a director for 10 years.. you're out. Perhaps you want to be an IC again, but sorry, I can't risk that. You likely need a gig and will jump at the first opportunity. My advise here is that if you truly want that, tailor your resume to stress that.
* 6th round: Interview with me. \~90% don't make it past me, and I'll explain why below.
* 7th round: Coding interview with team. If one of the team members is a no/maybe.. it's over.
* 8th round: Interview with engineering leader.
* 9th round: Interview with CTO, basically a meet &amp; greet. You really have to mess up to fail this round.

Alright, I'll share some observations on how I handle the bits where I have input.

***Resume/Profile review:***

We're trying to fill these roles, so the recruiter is chasing me to set up interviews. If I can please review 10 new profiles before lunch? I am booked solid from 9 till 1, but sure, I'll give it a spin. My 10am ends at 10:45, I guess I'll have a look now.... 15 minutes to review 10 profiles....

First, I click the link to your LinkedIn profile and check:

1. Clear, professional profile picture? 
2. Posting history?
3. Scroll to bottom and check education, certs and interests
4. Scroll from bottom to top and check your career path. I casually check out company/role, and a few of the bullits.
5. And I am taking mental notes of dates: graduated in 2010, jr eng at A for 2 years in 2010, engineer with B for 3 in 2012, etc

*While these are all non deal breakers*, I want to get a sense of who you are! So my recommendation here is to have a clear and professional photo of yourself. Posting on LI is ok, but don't be some incessant poster. List ALL the dates including your education, so I can follow your career along. Don't leave gaps unexplained (e.g. graduated in 2010 and then the first role is in 2015?). Put fewer details for older roles, put more details for newer roles. It's OK if you have a previous career (like me) in a different field, mention it!

Then I review the actual resume and treat it differently depending on years of experience. I am hiring a Jr and for people with 3-5 years I read every word. For the Sr role I check maybe 7 years back. I really don't care what you did back in 2015, it can be a totally different field.

This time I scan from the top down and read your current role very intently, the previous one a little less, and the 3rd just a cursory glance. I look certs and education, personal interest and hobbies. I don't like resumes that don't mention these sections and only list experiences.

As for resume themselves, layout and content? Oh boy... People throw some creative, but ultimate unreadable stuff out there!

**Formats:** Fancy formats with colors and fun fonts are probably OK in the creative space, but I care for NONE of it for the sole reason that it is hard to digest and I only have 15 min to review 10 resumes remember?

The Harvard Business school format is simple and concise. It's by far the best format out there. Boring AF, but so readable. Here is their template: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cJZIlwfCHBVcPPMxN0n5gUiEf1axv1\_ytv6mWkX7cgw/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cJZIlwfCHBVcPPMxN0n5gUiEf1axv1_ytv6mWkX7cgw/edit) 

**Layout:** 1-5 years experience? 1 page only! 5-15? 1-2 pages. 15+ sure, add a 3rd.

This is by FAR one of my biggest complaints. I do not have time to read 7 pages of resume. I get that people want to list every little thing they ever worked on, and I sometimes see 15+ bullets for a gig you were in for 5 month! WTF! My recommendation is to list no more than 7 bullets per role, and list fewer and fewer for older roles. For a job you held 10 years ago? It's OK to just list the role with no bullets at all.

**Content:** If your last few roles where in the same tech space, I don't want to read the same thing you did. E.g. ""troubleshot AWS issues"". Given that it's so basic, if you want to list that at all, list it for your oldest role. When I see that, I assume that skill carries to your more recent roles.

Instead I want to know how you went above and beyond. Show me that you were not just a user of tech but improved on it. E.g. ""Proficient in Microsoft Excel"". The subject here is Excel and it tells me you can use Excel and know the basics. ""Introduced macros and pivot tables for automated reporting in Excel"". The subject now is that you expanded upon Excel's abilities and it totally follows that you're obviously proficient in Excel, actually an expert in it.

This is to say that the bullets need to be more about YOU and what YOU did with a tech versus just mentioning that you know it.

And when I said to just list only a few bullets? These bullets have to be 1 LINE per bullet only, don't let them run on the next line!

**Yes, that means cutting all the crab and buzzwords ou**t of it and distill it to it's pure essence only.

I see a lot of things like ""*Upgrade process: When I first joined the company, the upgrade process was cumbersome and painful. After a few months I decided to improve on it, and researched a few alternatives before settling on tech A which made things easier for everyone and reduced complexity* ""

That should be a bullet like this: ""*Reduced upgrade complexity by 20% researching, introducing and tailoring tech A.*""

Each bullet needs to **start with an action word.** There are lists of those, e.g. here: [https://www.colorado.edu/career/job-searching/resumes-and-cover-letters/resumes/action-verbs-use-your-resume](https://www.colorado.edu/career/job-searching/resumes-and-cover-letters/resumes/action-verbs-use-your-resume)

**TL;DR:** You get 1.5 min of my time. I do not have time to figure out your fancy formatting and 7 pages of work history. Present a concise, filled out resume I can digest in short order. I need to see progressive experience with more details for the last roles.

From the things you do list I need to see **what you DID** and not what you KNOW.

After my review I decide whether the recruiter will do a screen. The recruiter then screens and rejects some and writes up maybes and yesses. I then review those notes and reject people at this stage, mostly based of what the recruiter suggests. ""I think he can do the job but he was a bit elusive on..."" -&gt; reject!

Then a Zoom interview is scheduled and we get 45min to chat. Most people fail this stage, and not even because I doubt their actual skills. **The #1 reason people don't make it past me because I could not establish a connection to them as a fellow human.**

As for the Zoom setup itself: I can't stress to be dressed appropriately, be in a well lit room and don't have a Zoom background that blends you in from time to time (blur is OK).

Additionally, have the camera facing you. A trick I learned is to make the Zoom window narrow in which case the other party pops to the top. I then move that window all the way up to have the person close to my own camera. That way it's almost as if your looking at each other.

Make sure the sound is ok, and that there is no one else in the room. Make sure there is no background noise. I've had people take calls from the car, from a coffee shop ""oh sorry, I just ordered a latte and it's ready, be right back"". These are massive turn offs!

**Show up on time and be on camera as soon as you join**. I've joined calls where the person likely stepped away and only opens his camera and sound a minute or 2 in. If you don't show up within 5 minutes I am dropping the call and tell the recruiter to move on.

Since I hate interviewing when looking for a job myself , and am usually nervous as fuck I appreciate interviewers who take the lead and give an intro and that is what I do. I hate interviewers who jump on a call and say 'So, tell me about you'.

Thus, I start the interview and give a 8-10 min intro about me, the company and the role. In my intro I say that when I am done I am asking *you* to introduce themselves and tell a bit about their job history and what they are looking for, so you have a 10 min headsup. That gives people a chance to get used to my voice and mentally prepare for their turn.

Now, when I do my 10min intro I do watch your body language closely. Are people taking notes? have expressions of surprise, smile, laugh? All those are big positives to me since it shows engagement. I interviewed one person in a dark lit room sitting in front of some sort of flag and he didn't move at all, with no expression whatshowever. It was like one of those hostage videos. By the time I was done my intro, I knew he would not be hired.

So.. first impressions matter!!! Feign interest if you must, but by jolly engage with the material, make notes and have expressions. I especially like if people then immediately ask a question after I am done: ""If I may, did you say the company was international based? Where is HQ?"" before launching into their own intro. **It tells me that I am speaking with a fellow human.**

Your own intro needs to be concise and span your whole career. ""Graduated in 2010, spent the first few years doing support when realized I liked development more, etc"". **Make this a 5-10 min thing and practice it over and over again.** **This is the meat of your application** and you need to rehearse it. Many people start to ramble and I have to cut them off, other people say just a few lines about their last role and then fall silent.

Then we dive into the role and it becomes a back and forth about experiences. But honestly, by then I usually already know if I am going to move ahead. Because **as the manager I need to know that you fit in my team,** that you are a normal human being. Whether you know the latest tech or relevant tech is not decided by me, but during the next coding interview. During the back and forth I really just watch how you formulate your answers, whether you ask questions, and how you describe problems and present yourself.

The last 5-10 min are for your questions: HAVE SOME prepared! Write down more questions than there is time. Ask the ones you have based on the interview first, then the more general ones.

Not asking any questions is a turn off to me (despite loving that I get 10 min back)..I.e. I am not doing anything to fill out the time allotted. If you ever don't make it to the end of the scheduled time then I bet you won't make it to the next round. It's also OK to ask about next steps, I don't volunteer those, but happily fill you in.

From there you are on your own, it's out of my hands. If you can't make it past my team due to insufficient skills, that's on you. I don't think any HRM has lots of influence at that point other than perhaps deciding between 2 candidates who made it all the way through.

Re-reading this makes me sound like a Nazi death camp doctor who has to decide if you live or not. But honestly, with some simple improvements anyone can make it past the HRM.

Happy to answer some questions, but don't want to review your profile for some custom tips lol.

Hope this all helps. Hang in there everyone! If you have been looking for months? Perhaps delete your resume and start over and take a new approach.

Hang in there and good luck!",446,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1c5grrw/now_being_an_hrm_ill_share_my_view_from_that_side/,2024-04-16T13:57:54Z
AI,recruitinghell,1my56ks,"I didn't get a job because I was profiled as a ""Video Gamer""","I was interviewed for a Afterschool Drama Teacher program at the local museum here. This was a virtual interview so I get the Google Meet email. When I joined, I notice that there was another in the room with us but it was an AI that was going to transcribe the meeting called Otter.AI. I didn't think much of it, I figure that this was protocol, whatever. 

Interview goes on, I feel good despite the little red flags I saw come up. But I need work and being lucky enough to get an interview in my field of choice, I hoped for the best. About 30 minutes after the interview concluded I get another email from Otter AI that shares what was transcribed. I felt like I wasn't suppose to see this but I decided hey, if anything I can go over the interview for myself and just take it as a healthy moment to critique myself. 

Little did I realize, the transcription continues after I left. 

I've attached what was said but, I was profiled as a ""video gamer"" and that was why I was not qualified for the job. 

At first I was pissed but then I had to laugh at the absurdity of it all. If that's their thought process, perhaps I dodged one big ol bullet! 

For transparency, yes I do play video games. But I have a professional resume filled with Teaching experience, industry and professional work under my belt. Granted sure I don't have a bachelors in theater work but I wanted to shoot my shot, knowing theres SOME overlap but I was willing to get my feet wet. And its for a kindergarten-program, not exactly putting on 'Kidz Bop Presents: Hamilton'. 

This is definitely the craziest rejection I've ever received. This is truly hell!

AI,recruitinghell,1o6cglm,Tldr; an undisclosed AI keyword scored my interview in real time,"Rant: 
One of the interviews I had recently was a job I was extremely overqualified for both in salary and in experience. But it was with a video game company so I applied anyway as that's a tough industry to break into. 

The interviewer (the Chief of Staff) started by being like ""this isn't a typical interview, tell us about yourself outside of work. This is a vibe check"" and then asked me just about that stuff and two questions like ""what do we do"". Extremely entry level questions. 

She didn't ask me a single thing about my background, experience, or resume. Only about myself explicitly ""outside of work"" and the 2 very junior questions about them.

At the end of the interview, when I asked if she has any concerns about my resume or our conversation she explained that she has NO INPUT on if I move forward. The Chief of Staff. Instead, an AI that has been recording our conversation is scoring me and that is what determines if I move forward. 

In an interview about my HOBBIES. 

Allegedly this was to ""remove bias"" (because AI is famously unbiased lol). And suddenly the interview made more sense. She didn't ask me about my work background because she probably didn't know it--an AI moved me forward. She didn't seem to know anything about me. 

If I had known an AI was scoring me, I would have done my interview entirely differently. Instead of trying to create a connection and establish rapport with the interviewer, I would have adjusted to speaking more about my work experience and background even when it was ostensibly not the purpose of the call. 

The whole thing was so icky and insulting (from the condescending entry level questions to telling me at the end that my conversation with her had no meaning unless the AI likes me) that I laughed when I got the rejection. 

Apparently I didn't ""vibe"" hard enough with the computer 🤷🏻‍♀️

Edit: addressing a few things quickly since this post BLEW up (it's literally my first reddit post and I was unprepared 😅). 
1. The title seems to confuse everyone so apologies, it's not an ""AI keyword"" it's that AI ""keyword-scored"" my interview. Admittedly an assumption on my part, but meaning that I imagine the AI was looking for certain keywords and scoring me based on my use of them. 
2. Still looking for a job and nervous at the amount of attention this post is getting so I won't name the company (yet, maybe after I get a job). But it wasn't a video game studio, it was an agency that helps video game studios advertise to influencers. So, in the industry, not directly working on video games. 
3. Chances are high I didn't nail the interview! It was still an off putting experience and I just wanted to rant about it. Thanks y'all! ",289,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1o6cglm/tldr_an_undisclosed_ai_keyword_scored_my/,2025-10-14T11:04:43Z

AI,recruitinghell,1nw105v,Unpopular opinion: I miss the days pre-AI as a recruiter,"I might get downvoted for this. But as a recruiter, things honestly felt better before AI took over everything, RE: iresumes, portfolios, emails, messages (!!!)

Back then, I could actually see someone’s individuality in their portfolio, their writing, and their emails. I would get a sense of their skills, but also their personality. Now everything feels copy pasted: same tone, same phrases, the same “perfect” wording. Half the time I can’t even tell if I’m talking to a real person or just reading a polished AI draft. I could smell ChatGPT from a mile away. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not anti-AI. I utilize ChatGPT, Gemini, all that good stuff, JamieAI for things like transcribing interviews. I even came across WorkBeaver AI that literally performs tasks from the description that was given. A lot of good and convenience has come out of AI.

But here’s the thing - I wish candidates used AI responsibly. Lean on it for structure or clarity, sure, but not to the point where everyone sounds identical. I’d rather read something imperfect but authentic than another templated wall of text that could’ve come from anyone.

Recruiting is already tough. AI just made it harder to spot the real standouts. 

 Unsolicited advice to people applying for jobs: Don't use a generic AI template in your emails/CVs. It automatically gets filtered in our brains 98% off the time. Try to sound human as cliche as that sounds. We read hundreds of emails per day, we could tell if you asked ChatGPT to ""Create a response for this: \[Insert message\]"".

AI,recruitinghell,1lg7oc5,PSA to candidates using AI in interviews: You’ve gotta try a little harder.,"I’ve seen this more and more over the past year...candidates clearly relying on AI during live interviews. And while I get it, AI isn’t going anywhere and it is used for resumes and cover letters. But using it mid-interview without finesse is becoming a deal-breaker.

If you're staring at the screen, repeating the question out loud, pausing awkwardly, and then delivering a robotic-sounding response like you're reading it off ChatGPT... it’s a no from us.

If you’re going to use AI tools to help prep, great. But once you’re in the actual interview, you need to sound like you and not like you’re reading a script in real time. It’s painfully obvious, and it makes us question your actual understanding and communication skills.

Just my two cents from the other side of the screen. 

EDIT: This post is not about discriminating against people who are neurodivergent or have autism. 
This is about being asked an interview question about your field of expertise and answering with a generic nonspecific response that does not answer the  question at all.

AI hiring,recruiting,1bzwpn6,AI in Recruitment &amp; Talent Acquisition,"I finished my IO Psychology MS and finally have some time to contribute more to the community and AreWeHiring.com. A recent topic that has been popping up a lot is [AI in recruiting](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/artificial-intelligence-in-hr). In addition to my background in Recruiting, I program and consult on HR and talent Acquisition technology and systems, including AI, automation, and analytics.  I wrote this quick article to provide some context to [AI in recruiting and talent acquisition](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/recruiterjonathonpalmieri_ai-chatgpt-recruiting-activity-7183193294468755458-6Gwh?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop). I thought it would be great to kick off a discussion with the r/recruiting community on the topic. Please post your comments and questions, and as always, you can find more blogs &amp; recruiting [resources on our Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/wiki/about) or the community site [AreWeHiring.com.](https://arewehiring.com/recruiter-talent-acquisition-resources/exploring-what-organizations-should-know-about-using-ai-in-recruitment-talent-acquisition-efforts/)

# Exploring what organizations should know about using AI in Recruitment &amp; Talent Acquisition efforts 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in business is increasingly becoming a focal point as organizations strive to enhance and streamline their workforce operations. As we delve into the realms of AI, it’s crucial to address a common gap in understanding what AI truly encompasses. This blog seeks to unravel the complexities surrounding AI, distinguishing between concepts like process automation and predictive analytics and generative AI, such as ChatGPT. As we explore the nuances of AI applications, including the emergent field of Prompt Engineering and the intricacies of AI training, we’ll also scrutinize the ethical and legal ramifications of AI-generated content and data usage. By dissecting these multifaceted issues, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of AI’s role in business and its broader implications.

AI in business is a growing trend, especially as many organizations look to optimize and augment their workforce. However, I think it’s important to mention that many organizations do not understand what AI is. The term has been thrown around to include process automation, predictive/advanced analytics, and generative AI (ChatGPT). These misunderstandings often conflate the topic; for example, within generative AI, many people confuse training with AI chat prompt manipulation. Prompt manipulation is absolutely something useful in leveraging AI, hence the emergence of the “Prompt Engineering” job. However, training is where many advancements are happening. It’s also important to know where data comes from, who owns it, and how it is being used in training. It is extremely important to the resulting impacts of how we work with AI and how organizations leverage it. For example, when [Amazon tried to create an AI recruiting tool](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1MK0AG/), it resulted in unintentional bias. Most likely propagated by implicit bias in their training data and model-building methods. Another issue is ownership not only of the data but also of the content being generated [According to Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=93cf3f01-5e64-4088-9af6-237fd38165e9#:~:text=The%20Copyright%20Office%20guidance%20indicates,Office%20will%20not%20register%20it) , “the Copyright Office guidance indicates AI-generated content may be copyright protected if the work is in some way original and unique.” But is content based on scraped and acquired data original? Also, what if that generated content comes from an AI model that is scraping data illegally? There are dozens of lawsuits going after large technology companies scraping AI model training data[ International Association of Privacy Professionals](https://iapp.org/news/a/lawsuit-accuses-openai-microsoft-of-illegal-data-scraping/).

These topics, and others, extend to how we look at utilizing AI in the Talent space. A recent post on the Reddit forum I moderated on r/humanresources was a call for advice on catching people using ChatGPT / Generative AI on their resumes. Surprisingly, the mass opinion was that no one cared if people used a tool (ChatGPT) to create their content; they viewed it no differently than hiring a writer or career coach. However, the problem stemmed from wrongfully representing themselves. Therein lies the danger: when you have something like AI creating content, with little visibility into how it is making the content and problems such as Hallucinations (incorrect or misleading results) from AI, you open yourself or your company up to liability or poor results. Just look at NYC’s AI chatbot telling [business’ to do illegal things](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/nycs-ai-chatbot-was-caught-telling-businesses-to-break-the-law-the-city-isnt-taking-it-down/5287713/). Similar problems in the talent world exist, such as [benefits chatbots](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/5-benefits-using-ai-bots-customer-service/) generating incorrect results for employees (or incoming candidates), which can open the company up to liability. I recommend that companies utilize strict RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques to limit hallucinations and ground AI text generation by providing context. However, I still believe organizations should use these AI techniques to augment rather than replace HR &amp; recruitment professionals.

Lastly, I see many more companies interested in [measuring employee &amp; candidate experience trends](https://rexrecruiting.com/how-to-measure-candidate-experience/), which are important people metrics as they relate to employee performance, engagement, satisfaction, and retention, and turnover. These are topics that many companies, such as [Deloitte, have recognized as growing HR trends](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-trends.html) . Candidate experience is important as it relates to the likelihood of hiring qualified candidates, and it is related to the outcomes of that candidate as an employee. Furthermore, candidate experience impacts employer branding as well as consumer decisions. Simply put, if your company provides a poor candidate experience by hiring low-quality recruiters (or outsourced recruiters), having a poor interview process, or having marketplace misaligned jobs, you are hurting your company in a variety of ways. When talking about AI from a candidate experience perspective, the saying, “People join people, and people hire people,” comes to mind. Adding in-personal technology, such as an AI chatbot, removes that people element and retracts from the candidate’s experience.

In conclusion, the integration of AI in business, especially in the talent and HR sectors, poses both opportunities and challenges. As companies increasingly leverage AI to enhance candidate and employee experiences, it’s imperative to balance technological advancements with ethical considerations and human touch. While AI can significantly augment HR functions, it should not replace the nuanced judgment and empathy that human professionals bring to the table. Ensuring responsible use of AI, addressing potential biases, and maintaining transparency will be crucial in harnessing AI’s full potential while safeguarding against its pitfalls. Ultimately, fostering a holistic approach that values both technology and human interaction will be key to achieving sustainable success in the evolving landscape of AI in business.

Using my own LLM model running a Mistral model I created a TLDR (though its not that short lol)

TL;DR: AI in business, particularly in recruitment and talent acquisition, is growing in importance but is often misunderstood, conflating different aspects like process automation, analytics, and generative AI. Ethical and legal issues, such as data ownership and bias, are significant concerns, as demonstrated by Amazon's biased AI recruiting tool. The emergence of ""Prompt Engineering"" highlights the importance of understanding AI's capabilities and limitations. While AI can enhance HR functions, it shouldn't replace human judgment. Responsible AI use, addressing biases, and maintaining human interaction are essential for leveraging AI's benefits while avoiding its pitfalls in the talent and HR sectors",37,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1bzwpn6/ai_in_recruitment_talent_acquisition/,2024-04-09T16:39:13Z

AI hiring,recruitinghell,1en3e7w,I got a job!…from LinkedIn!,"Little bit of a hopeful post. A month ago I saw a job position on LinkedIn for my dream job in my field. I applied on there and to my entire surprise, got the job! (Also I had 0 connections with the work!!)

What I did:

A.) Before I applied, I took my resumes and put them through multiple AI scanners to score it (because I’ve heard some jobs won’t even look at your resume if their AI reviewer scores it bad)- and when it was at least a 70% rating on multiple websites I called it good enough.

B.) I saw from TikTok saying how a lot of hiring managers get impressed whenever someone on LinkedIn reaches out to them to express their interest- so I did. A week before- is when I put in the application, I was just trying to hit the nail on the coffin. The lady replied saying to submit a job application to which I replied that I did a week prior and “wanted to express how enthusiastic for the role I was”

C.) During the 2 (and a half) interviews I had, I have a problem where I tend to ramble on. I’ve learned to use that as a prop and when I ramble I find a good stopping point and excitedly apologize about rambling and emphasize how passionate I am about whatever the question was. They ate that response up. 

D.) At the end is always try to ask personal questions-less about where the company will be in the future but more so getting a person-to-person connection with the interviewer. Like what they hope for for my position, where they personally think the job is heading etc. (I used to be one of those people that didn’t ask questions and all the questions I’d see online when looking for ideas felt too bland and cookie cutter)

I will say- I think a lot of it may have just been right place right time because this job is one of the first of its kind so there wasn’t a lot of people I was fighting against. 

But all that to say, I landed by dream job through applying on LinkedIn with no previous connections to the work! (And it’s from a legit and reputable company?!) Didn’t think that was possible. I start at my new job in a week today!

Good luck on your journeys. ",104,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1en3e7w/i_got_a_jobfrom_linkedin/,2024-08-08T11:22:50Z

Second, the lack of respect for our time that you showed by failing to send our test links in advance is indicative of your attitude towards people. What exactly do you expect me to do when you say ""Ooops! We don't have the links for you yet, but we're totally working on it!!!""? You expect me to wait on the edge of my seat without knowing when and if the invite arrives? When this fuckup happened, you should have picked another date for the tests.  
Third, and most important: having candidates send you recordings of themselves for you to jerk off to for a CODING JOB is LAUGHABLE. Besides, I do not have a webcam and I would not ever consider infecting my phone with some random hiring app. It is ridiculous. Maybe try hackerrank next time.  
I am very glad that you have shown all these red flags so willingly and so early. I want no business with your company and I hope you will go bankrupt soon.  
By the way, I hereby retract the consent to process any of the data I shared with you.

AI hiring,recruitinghell,1ppyrfc,Just fired a “perfect hire” after 4 weeks,"I need to vent, but also genuinely ask how you guys are handling this.

I just had to reopen a req for a Senior role because our hire was a perfect match on paper, but week 3 on the job? The Hiring Manager calls me furious. The guy can’t do the basics. It’s becoming obvious his resume was likely AI-generated to beat the screener, and he memorized just enough to pass the interview.

It feels like the conventional resume is becoming a liability. With AI tools, anyone can look like a perfect match.

Honestly, I wish we could just move to a model where experience is ""Verified"" upfront so I don't have to guess if the PDF is real or ChatGPT.

Are you guys adding more assessment layers to combat this?

EDIT: I’m getting roasted in the comments so I want to clarify:

1. I messed up. I realize now this is a space for candidates to vent, and I walked in here complaining as a recruiter.
2. I am not looking for sympathy. Letting this person go wasn't just a ""cost"" to the company; it cost a human being their job security and left them with a gap on their CV. That is a failure of my process, not just their performance. I failed to assess them correctly, and we both paid the price.
3. The real reason I posted: I genuinely feel like the ""Resume + Interview"" system is broken. AI has made it easy to inflate a resume, but our screening process hasn't changed to catch it. We are judging people on how well they sell themselves, not what they have actually done. 

So, genuine question for you guys (since you are on the other side): If the Resume is becoming unreliable (because of AI), and you guys hate LeetCode/Assessments (rightfully so)... what is the alternative?",96,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ppyrfc/just_fired_a_perfect_hire_after_4_weeks/,2025-12-18T18:49:44Z
AI hiring,recruitinghell,1lpgx2t,AI is screening resumes before a human ever sees them,"What is so maddening to me as a former HR exec is that this is not only incredibly rude and cruel, but also the worst possible way to hire people.

If you could choose the best candidates based solely  on their résumé, we wouldn’t need interviews – but we do.

Beyond that, employers need talented candidates to stay in the pipeline. 

I don’t know how anyone could expect a person with other options to stay in their recruiting process when they are treated so badly from the very first interaction.

The recruiting process has never been more broken than it is right now, and adding AI to the mix is just pouring gasoline on the fire.

AI recruiting,recruiting,1cpge8d,Automating Initial Screening Calls for Software Developers?,"
Hey fellow recruiters,

I was recently approached by a company that offers an AI-powered tool designed to automate the initial screening calls for software developers. Looks like this tool operates at the top of the recruitment funnel and designed to handle preliminary assessments through AI-driven conversations.
As someone who spends a considerable amount of time on phone screens, I'm intrigued but also a bit skeptical. The idea is that it can save us a lot of time by filtering out candidates and do it better than ATS with basic resume parsers. I’m so tired of GPT generated CVs.  On the other hand, I wonder if it might screen out good candidates who just don't interview well in such a format or miss out on the nuances that a human recruiter might catch. But if I can screen 50 engineers with this tool and save 100(50x20min for the screen) hours of my time , I’d use it. 

I'm curious to hear your thoughts:

 • Do you think such a tool could be effective in improving the quality and efficiency of the recruitment process?

 • Have you had any experience with similar automation tools?

 • What are your main concerns about relying on AI for initial candidate assessments?

Thanks in advance!",34,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1cpge8d/automating_initial_screening_calls_for_software/,2024-05-11T12:27:53Z

AI recruiting,recruiting,xrcdt4,Automated sourcing of matching+interested candidates?,"So, I am a technical recruiter with an engineering background. I like to automate repetitive things. Having done tech talent sourcing for quite sometime now, I felt the entire process of talent sourcing to be be extremely tedious with infinite repetitive manual tasks of searching, screening, then pitching roles to each candidate. I feel I would like to focus more on delivering a great experience to candidates further down the funnel(shortlisted and beyond) rather than sitting behind a screen all day and searching and making cold calls to pitch a job opening to matching candidates.

To save myself the manual work, I built an AI engineered tool that instantly searches, screens and automatically pitches a job to matching candidates without any manual intervention. The matching candidates automatically receive a message on their WhatsApp and email with the detailed job description, company profile, founders profile, funding status etc. If a candidate likes the opening, they can express interest by clicking a button in WhatsApp and email. As soon as the candidate expresses interest, his profile, resume and contact information reaches recruiters inbox 🙂

I'm an Intern and I want to suggest the use of an ATS that automates the screening with ai to make the recruiting process more efficient. Nobody in the company has ever used one (at least in the Mexico site, but I believe not even in the US because the HR VP doesn't know about any either). The way we manage resumes is through excel and through job application websites and manually scroll through each resume.

But, the current solutions seem like they kind of suck. It's clearly too early in the space right now.

Just wanted to get thoughts from other recruiters.

AI recruiting,recruiting,dzom7j,AI Recruitment Software that Source,"Hello our company is starting to look at AI software to help with a lot of our seasonal roles.  For these roles we basically need someone with a pulse, comfortable with shitty pay and a seasonal job.    


So basically we have to phone screen everyone who applies.  We see AI jumping in to help out with those initial screens where we are just confirming they applied to a seasonal role, get how many hours they want to work and confirm compensation.    


We're seeing some companies selling AI sourcing as well and I was wondering if any recruiters have used this feature?

We had a pitch from paradox and it went really well but it feels like our Director is getting hoodwinked by other companies claims that they could do a lot of our sourcing for us.  There would be value in having an AI system openly source for these roles but I'm not sold that it will actually find people really looking.  Anyone used an AI for sourcing?

*Reporting functionality

*Lead source tracking via custom URL (i.e. whether a candidate came via Indeed/LinkedIn etc)

*A wide range of integration options to expand its capabilities

*Ability to connect with LinkedIn Recruiter to manage messaging within the system

*Scheduling features with automatic meeting reminders

AI screening,recruitinghell,1ol4b3q,Behind Every Desperate Job Seeker Is Someone Just Trying to Survive,"I’ve seen people, including someone who commented on my post, say that those who are unemployed and are desperately seeking jobs are part of the problem in this brutal job market. That’s really hard to read, it hurts. Most are simply trying to keep their lives afloat. Rent is due, families need support, and people apply where they genuinely believe they can do the work.

I appreciate the perspective, and I’m genuinely glad when someone hasn’t had to go through what many of us have, I hope they never do. But unemployed people aren’t the problem. The issue is a system that’s creaking. If someone is doing everything they can to support themselves or their family in a tough economy, you can’t label them ""the problem."" And, realistically, people don’t apply to roles they think they can’t handle.

So what is going on? With full respect to the experts, it’s a mix of factors, where you live, the growing tendency to hire cheaper talent offshore, and a global market that has shifted fast. Remote work widened the competition, automation and AI reduced demand for some roles, and many companies are cutting costs by replacing experienced staff with lower-paid or contract workers. Economic uncertainty also makes employers more risk-averse, they prefer candidates who already match every single requirement rather than those who could grow into the role. On top of that, the big layoff waves haven’t helped:

* Google: \~12,000 layoffs announced Jan 20, 2023.
* Amazon: 18,000 roles cut announced Jan 5, 2023.
* Microsoft: \~9,000 roles (about 4% of the workforce) announced Jul 2, 2025.

And there were many more.

Companies often cite reasons like economic slowdown, over-hiring during the pandemic, a shift to AI/automation, and general inefficiencies. These numbers matter. The flood of experienced talent from companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others has packed the market with tens of thousands of strong applicants. For each opening, especially in areas like software engineering, data science, or product management, there can be hundreds of candidates, many with top-tier backgrounds. That surplus pushes expectations higher: niche skills, spotless CVs, tailored applications just to get an interview. Even solid candidates can be overlooked or stuck in long searches. The market is brutally selective right now, driven by perception, networks, and algorithmic screening as much as merit. These days, being qualified isn’t always enough; you also have to be visible, positioned well, and consistently adaptive.

A quick UK example: plenty of companies hire Tech Leads, Engineering Managers, and Lead Engineers locally, while outsourcing many other roles to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, or South Asia to reduce costs.

So before judging anyone for trying too hard, take a moment to think about what they might be carrying, the fear, the pressure, the sleepless nights. Behind every “desperate job seeker” is someone fighting quietly to keep hope alive.

Be kind. This market is already cruel enough. A bit of empathy can go a long way.",27,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ol4b3q/behind_every_desperate_job_seeker_is_someone_just/,2025-10-31T19:45:05Z
