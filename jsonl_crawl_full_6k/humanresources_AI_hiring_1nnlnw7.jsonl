Not just a 30 second sample video. Have them DO an interview, if only even a few questions, to get the true experience and see what feedback the system provides.

Would they consider that efficient and resourceful? Or dishonest and cheating? If the latter, then does the same reflect on the org if they use it on their end?\n\nEducate them on how AI recruiting tools have been found to have bias in the past. Example: “The system preferred: white-associated names 85% of the time versus Black-associated names 9% of the time; and male-associated names 52% of the time versus female-associated names 11% of the time.”\n(Source: https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/10/31/ai-bias-resume-screening-race-gender/#:~:text=October%2031%2C%202024-,AI%20tools%20show%20biases%20in%20ranking%20job%20applicants'%20names%20according,Alejandro%20Escamilla/Unsplash)\n\nCompare data about how many candidates drop out of the process at that point with regular interviewing vs AI. My guess is it would be higher and you could show you’re losing candidates.

What percentage of people who apply, complete an AI interview through this technology? How will this affect our Brand and will this reduce our candidate pool for hard to fill roles? How do you want to handle that?\n\n2. What’s the average reduction in time to hire for NON- High Volume hiring use cases with this tool? Do they even have any non-high volume customers to compare? My guess is no as the technology to support these is new (like the last 1 or 2)\n\n3. Bias! How do they comply with national and international AI laws (Colorado, New York, EU AI Act)? Are they independently audited for bias? My guess is no which leads to legal liability concerns. \n\n4. If we put this in place how are we measuring success/failure? How do we know if we should continue using this tool? What’s the timeline to determine this?\n\nAt the end of the day, software decisions are often not made by people in the trenches doing the work day by day.

{"id": "ngm2s5z", "text": "Youre not wrong to worry. But just to share, ive been running thousands of AI interviews every month for the last 7 months and what im actually seeing is candidates (esp Gen Z) are a lot more cool with it than ppl expect.\n\nThey care more abt speed and fairness than the “first convo must be human” idea. For them, getting an interview right away, not waiting 2 weeks for a recruiter slot, and doing it at 10pm if they want matters more. Some even say its less stressful cos the bot doesnt judge their accent or rush them.\n\nAlso the consistency part is big. Every candidate gets asked the same way, no bad mood recruiter, no random bias. Gen Z notices that and takes it as fairer shot.\n\nI agree rapport and culture are important, but honestly most candidates dont expect to feel culture in a first 15 min screen. They just want to get through it quick and know theyll meet a real person later. If you position AI as saving time not replacing humans, they usually embrace it.\n\nSo ya, the gut feeling makes sense, but reality is younger candidates are actually leaning in, not pushing back.", "timestamp": "2025-09-28T07:20:46Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Need your opinion: Company wants AI to run first interviews and I’m uneasy about it [CO]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1nnlnw7/need_your_opinion_company_wants_ai_to_run_first/"}}
{"id": "nzsbsyn", "text": "What you're describing as unease is often a proxy for a design failure that hasn't been named yet.\n\nThe issue isn't whether AI should screen, but it's more about whether your organization has answered: who owns the hiring decision when the AI scores someone as 'not a fit' but the hiring manager disagrees? What happens when a candidate challenges the questions or the fairness of the process? Who designed the questions, and did Legal approve them?\n\nIn my work, I see many companies discover these constraints after launch, when adoption quietly stalls or a compliance issue surfaces.
