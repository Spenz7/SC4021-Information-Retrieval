{"id": "m7vwk60", "text": "Well, yes. \n\nI’m not saying to toss people aside because their resume isn’t perfect—far from it. But if you see clear gaps in critical qualifications for the role, why proceed with a screening call only to confirm what was already evident? It wastes time for both the candidate and the recruiter. If there’s doubt about their experience beyond the resume, that’s fair—but maybe ask clarifying questions via email or during a pre-screening phase before scheduling a full interview.\n\nThis isn’t about rejecting candidates with imperfect resumes; it’s about respecting their time and setting clearer expectations. Candidates often feel that recruiters don’t take the time to assess fit before scheduling calls, and that’s frustrating, especially in a competitive job market. Constructive feedback is important, but transparency and empathy go a long way too.\n\nIf you're looking for someone who uses Megablocks, but you're specifically looking for lego experience, then you really should not call that person. If they maybe have some experience with Legos then that's fair game. \n\nThe resume is a calling card with basic info. Candidates are often applying to roles outside their scope because of the shenanigans of companies. If they fit the description perfectly, they are over qualified. They will not know if the skills are transferable. \n\nYour feedback for the candidate is literally useless.", "timestamp": "2025-01-18T23:28:10Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Why do candidates complain about getting  feedback, then don’t like the feed back.
