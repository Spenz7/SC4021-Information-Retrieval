There’s the greeter at the door who checks receipts.\n\nMy husband was at Walmart yesterday and said they had removed self checkouts at our store.

However since 2020, people in general are so much more aggressive and frustrated, I'm seeing way less emotional intelligence. Which leads to so much conflict. A job that was difficult (for the reasons you noted) is becoming untenable. Employee relations as far as the eye can see, even reasonable accommodations are started in acrimony.

But people with backgrounds in IT can find joy in HRIS. People who like sales can find joy in recruiting. There's all types of disciplines in HR. You're not wrong that it's changing, but that's true of most industries.\n\n&gt;Do you see the field improving or getting harder?\n\nI think it'll be different. A serious concern I have in HR , especially with younger professionals is their inability to develop relationships. I've noticed a lot of people who retreat to an office and aren't willing to make themselves known or available to colleagues. \n\n&gt;How do you see AI shaping our roles in the next five years?\n\nProbably more tightly integrated by default. At a past role we had a phone system that would auto flag recordings for coachable moments. Managers would bump this up to HR and we'd start the process of formally logging the incident. \n\nI foresee a lot of that. I also foresee LLM like you mentioned generating a lot more emails , newsletters and so on. I have a pet theory that eventually someone will feed a LLM some big piece of sensitive data and a bad actor will use prompts to sus out that data and it'll trigger some huge piece of crackdown/legislation. Either that or the wild west will be opened. \n\n&gt;What do you wish you had known before you started?\n\nI had an experience where I fundamentally changed a young woman's career and it was all sunshine, rainbows and puppies. That moved me from management to HR. \n\nI really wish I'd have been made aware of how bad it feels when people in a toxic culture run from you. I remember in a retail setting one person fucking off to pretend to work EVERY TIME he saw me. But I also wish people would have prepared me for how good it feels to turn the corner with those people.\n\nThis isn't a hard HR thing but we all have that one fucking person who thinks you're their personal HR team and shrink and your phone rings off the hook or you roll your eyes when they're coming.
