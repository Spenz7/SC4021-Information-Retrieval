It also scheduled a reminder for me to check in with them after their first week. \n\nI have also automated the task creating in Asana for my team, so when a new applicant is added to a spreadsheet a task is created and depending on the location gets assigned to the correct person, who can do their steps and then assign it to the next one.

{"id": "mf4h9a0", "text": "There are no good use cases for AI right now, other than making weird fan-art and making it write joke song lyrics.  It's a solution in search of a problem.  \n\nWhy you shouldn't use AI:  Using AI for any business purpose requires inputting data into someone else's systems, data which is often protected or sensitive and for which the AI companies offer no security or data protection assurances.  They *will* use any data you put into it, they tell you that up front.  Many companies are already putting policies in place that make it a fireable offense to give any potentially sensitive information to an AI like ChatGPT.  Including things like PHI, personal information, and compensation data.  So that rules out just about anything comp, benefits, or leave related. \n\nAI can't reliably give you personalized outputs without putting all that data into it, so using it for things like Performance Management or Discipline will fail to save time.  You'll spend as much time entering data and adjusting the prompt as you would just doing it yourself.  And it'll still require editing after you get an output.  \n\nAI doesn't guarantee the results as accurate, so you can't rely on any outputs.  So anything the HR team has a fiduciary responsibility for still needs human review or you risk breaking the law.  You can ask it to write you a WFH policy, but you can't be sure that policy is legally compliant so, again, you're having a human review and re-write it and spending more time and money, not less.  You can't have it advise anyone on how to update their W4.\n\nAny data processing you need is better done by automating the system to collect data.  AI can't update your HRIS when someone makes a change.  It can't give you data analytics better than something like IBM Cognos or any of the other major data platforms.  And, again, can't do any of that without sharing all your confidential data with someone who explicitly tells you they're using it for their own purposes, potentially in violation of privacy laws.", "timestamp": "2025-02-27T19:40:16Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Boss wants AI in HR [N/A]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1izo2sd/boss_wants_ai_in_hr_na/"}}

He didn't address any of that, he *responded* to it by disagreeing.  But without....you know, evidence or counterpoints.  \n\nThey say it helps write, which I addressed up top, it doesn't do that any better than just googling samples, at least as I've seen it.  And I've demoed several enterprise systems, including both Westlaw Precision, Lexis Create+ and CoCounsel with AI, all of which are legal research and writing platforms that are absolute dogshit at research and writing compared to basic search parameters and basic templates.  I can search a sample pleading and work it up 5x faster than re-writing an AI one that will cite to nonexistent case law and force me to do extra research to get it right.

Workday could also be lying to us; when I worked for a very aggressive Google talent competitor we still used Google Sheets for comp. What’s the joke? We call it risk management, not risk elimination.\n\nMost people in HR aren’t writing legal briefs or using WestLaw. Since you reference pleadings, it sounds like you’re an active paralegal or practicing attorney, and your use cases might be atypical for HR. This is an HR subreddit.\n\nThe way you describe templatized documents is also unique and more indicative of legal, not HR business needs: at least anywhere I‘ve practiced in the last decade, HR doesn’t really have boilerplate or off-the-shelf templates in the way that might exist for commercial contracts or litigation. Offer letters, maybe? But those are ATS-generated. PIPs have a template but are deeply customized. Perf reviews benefit enormously from LLMs, but that’s already built into Lattice for us.\n\nSo as HR practitioners for other use cases, when we create business writing it often varies meaningfully and non-repeatably.\n\nFor example my use case this and last week has been, “redesign the long-term compensation strategy.” That means consolidating a number of technical points, data, and qualitative arguments into discrete decision documents for different audiences: C-suite, CFO, CEO, CC, Board, majority shareholders. There aren’t Googleable samples for this work, not least because each of those audiences needs to be approached in a distinct way, and it’s kind of bizarre to me that you’d assume that there would be templates for this. A strong LLM can engage with you from first principles, and pass through multiple revisions. Claude is very good at this.\n\nA 3-sided GPT, which I’m sure you understand from your rapid Googling but I’ll nevertheless explain here, is a conversational tool that I can use so an employee becomes A, a loaded data set and instruction set becomes B, and my team and I become C. The employee A can then interact with the data B in a way my team can supervise; it’s like we’re able to supervise multiple conversations at once, a concept often described as “scale.” Employees can directly query their own data together with FAQs and a built-in escalation mechanism.\n\nFinally, bringing in a work styles and communications preference into another GPT to better help my team interact with each other and our partners reflects our commitment to become progressively better partners to each other. It also reflects that increasing scope and responsibility in HR means adapting communication styles to others “where they are.” This is continuous, ongoing professional development and I expect my total rewards team at all levels to continue sharpening the saw. (We are a support function and relationships are what we use to deliver our products.)\n\nIt’s clear that you might think consciously adapting to an audience, for the sake of partnership, is beneath you.

Which was that if you need GPT to do that for you instead of doing the work of learning how to communicate, you're in pretty big trouble as an HR function and an employee in general.  That's not \"consciously adapting\" to an audience, it's intentionally and willfully NOT adapting to an audience and getting something else to do that for you.  It's the \"bringing your mom to a job interview\" of communicating with others.  Adapting to your audience is work communication 101.  It's foundational to working with other people, and it requires a lot more than having well-drafted emails.  AI can't speak for you on the phone or in person.
