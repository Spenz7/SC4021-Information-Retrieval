And again, it's both analytical and predictive because recruitment is about trying to do both at the same time. So, obviously, AI as a prediction tool is deleterious to diversity because of a diversity-validity dilemma, i.e. the higher the predictive validity of an assessment tool, the lower the diversity of selection. Therefore, it may seem that being assessed by AI is the poorer choice.

{"id": "je00r7i", "text": "All the hysteria about AI replacing jobs rarely specifies the kinds of jobs AI will likely replace.\n\nAI, at least in it's current form, would be well positioned to generate basic documents, merge information, look up and synthesize various facts, etc. Pretty much replace junior level work. The reason the legal industry is poised to be hit heavily is what I wrote above is probably 70% of a paralegals job description.\n\nI don't think AI, at least for the near future, is poised to take over nuanced thought. Evaluating the facts of a sexual harassment investigation, determining a benefits and compensation strategy, even offering coaching to an employee or manager, are all things I think humans will continue to excel at over AI.", "timestamp": "2023-03-28T13:12:38Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "ChatGPT replacing ER Investigators", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/123xx18/chatgpt_replacing_er_investigators/"}}
