If given a strong LLM fine-tuned and trained to a specific task, with clear instruction, these AI-powered automations have the potential to streamline, augment, or even absorb certain roles/responsibilities, but will also create jobs too. However, I think there are some rather large caveats to the evolution of AI to even get close to the extreme point of HR being obsolete which include\n\n1. Hardware, software, infrastructure, and labor limitations\n2. Training data, techniques, and creating effective models is difficult and may often be task specific\n3. Lack of AI model decision transparency, hallucinations and misinformation, nad lack of effective evaluation leading to operational, financial and legal liability exposure.\n\nSo, back to your question about AI  leading to layoffs. I don't think (currently) there is any bigger threat to AI causing layoffs than any other type of automation, integration, or technology implementation in the business world. Instead, I think AI and other advancements in technology are going to shift the labor markets into requiring higher-skilled and/or more agile labor. AI, at least in the short run, will be amazing at augmenting workforces, including recruitment &amp; HR. Still, along the way, there are going to be many companies (like we see with all kinds of technology) that fumble and are hurt over utilizing AI. You also have to remember that many companies and industries still use Excel or paper notebooks as their business software. Large organizations with million-dollar ERP implementations still have large portions of workers and leaders working outside of and around the systems. ", "timestamp": "2024-04-12T00:20:47Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "HR and AI: will areas of HR become obsolete?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1c1ppt3/hr_and_ai_will_areas_of_hr_become_obsolete/"}}
