{"id": "kgtzlwd", "text": "I'd agree not blockchain just for the simple fact that it's still a fairly niche and small industry overall, it is an industry I'd pay close attention to and ensured I stayed up to date on. In the late 1980's and early 1990's everybody who was anybody from investment firms to your neighbors laughed you out of the room if you were talking about investing in these computer things thinking they would ever be smaller than an entire corner of an office building and actually have one in even half of the USA homes let alone some super crazy \"software\" or even worse \"internet\" company thing. Visa (and all other major card companies) have either built or are building test nets on blockchains now. Blockchain technology as of right now is probably equal to the days of Windows 95 at best, and still has a long ways to come.... but they are now getting to the level where the scalability is becoming useful for real world use cases. TPS or transactions per second that the blockchain can process..... there are a couple right now that are able to process more transactions per second for less money, all while being decentralized thus making \"hacking\" infinitely more difficult than current Visa/Mastercard/Amex/Discover networks can do now. There are some actual use cases for the NFT's and it's not absurdly priced monkey pictures. The space is starting to find its footing, and while nobody knows the future, it's definitely a sector I wouldn't dismiss by any means.", "timestamp": "2024-01-08T02:37:08Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "The healthiest recruitment niche over the next 5 to 10 years?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/190yaqs/the_healthiest_recruitment_niche_over_the_next_5/"}}

Most of our placements our entire careers have been Accounting and Finance. Typically the more technical the better. For example, if you specialize in placing people that do things like SEC Reporting, Technical Accounting and Internal Audit people, it’ll be in demand forever. No company is excited to spend money on accountants but they feel better saving money when they bring people in-house for it. Plus all of these companies that went public via SPAC have a bunch of people who don’t know much about SEC reporting or have no IA department, so they’re spending $300/hr for a consultant from PwC to handle it. It’s industry fluid, a lot of people don’t recruit for it well - at all and as long as there are federally mandated rules and regs, it exists.", "timestamp": "2024-01-08T01:15:03Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "The healthiest recruitment niche over the next 5 to 10 years?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/190yaqs/the_healthiest_recruitment_niche_over_the_next_5/"}}
