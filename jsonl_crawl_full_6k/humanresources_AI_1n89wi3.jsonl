Basically, there’s no such thing as overtime, since working hours aren’t defined. So depending on your workload, it might be 35 hours/week, 40 hours, 50 hours, and so on. So when you start your day, you never really know what time it’s going to end.  \n\nNow, yes, there’s a legal “right to disconnect,” so technically you’re not supposed to be working at 10 pm but in reality the “long-hours culture” is still very strong. Meaning a lot of people stay later at the office because it’s seen as a sign that you’re dedicated and willing to go the extra mile. Even if that same person took a 2-hour lunch break and had five coffee breaks during the day.  \n\nThat’s the complete opposite of what you see in many other European countries, where if you’re still at the office after hours, it just means you don’t know how to organize your work.  \n\nIt’s slowly changing with the younger generation. Personally, I’ve been working for 15 years, and honestly I don’t care, I know when my job is done, and I have no problem leaving at 4:30 p.m. if I’ve got an hour-long commute to go pick up my kid from daycare.  \n\nHappy to answer any questions!", "timestamp": "2025-09-05T07:01:28Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Should we adopt France’s “no work calls after 6pm” rule?

{"id": "ncj3v6i", "text": "I personally think this will eventually become common practice everywhere. \n\nMy boss was surprised when I told him that I personally delete teams from my phone, and log out of LinkedIn and my email when I’m on holiday. I simply will not shut off and chill out if I have the ability to check my email or my teams messages, so that defeats the entire purpose of taking a break. I have anxiety and I tend to get in my own head about work if I don’t set strict limits for myself, so answering work messages when I’m away from my desk is a one way track to burn out for me. He didn’t push back, but I could tell he wasn’t impressed. My coworkers then revealed they do the same thing and do not check their emails or teams notifications on their days off. \n\nEventually, my boss realised he was getting nowhere with trying to contact us outside of work, we were unavailable and unreachable and there wasn’t really anything he could do about it. I’m very firm with this boundary. I once even reported someone to HR for messaging me on my personal WhatsApp about a mistake I’d made at work. He did this on my sole day off that week, so I wasn’t about to tolerate that behaviour. Everyone aged 35 or under in my office has this same boundary. As they move up through the corporate ladder, they’ll soon implement those same boundaries as company policy. \n\nI do understand the argument that certain individuals, like CEOs or other high level managers, should be available in case of emergencies. However, most people aren’t in those roles. I also understand the argument that international teams should be able to communicate, but I do think there are ways around this. For example, if a business operates in the US and in Europe, maybe there could be a day or two each week when the US team arrives to the office earlier in the day for more overlap with the European team? I genuinely think constant availability is a one way track to burnout, and there are plenty of ways around constantly being available.", "timestamp": "2025-09-05T10:07:54Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Should we adopt France’s “no work calls after 6pm” rule?

{"id": "nclmfk4", "text": "I'm the founder of an early-stage startup and work-life balance is an ongoing challenge. As a smaller company in which each employee wears multiple hats, it's almost unavoidable that situations will arise where emails after 6pm or on weekends happen. Our software is also available across multiple countries, so we get support requests at all hours of the day. \n\n  \nWith all of the above said, I would suggest:\n\n1. Setting expectations is critical. If the job is likely to involve some 'outside of normal work hours' emails or calls, that this should be communicated up front.\n\n2. Adding as much automation as possible to minimize the need for extra calls and emails. For example, we have a bot to help respond to support requests when we're offline. While not perfect, it at least lets customers knows that we've received their support request and sets an expectation as to when we'll be able to get back to them. It also proactively proposes other resources they can refer to to potentially resolve the issue themselves. (Note, I totally understand that this wouldn't apply to an over-zealous boss who emails their employees at all hours of the day)\n\n3. Be sure to show appreciation to employees when work outside of normal work hours. Here I'm not referring to over-time pay. But at our company, we do let employees accumulate over-time hours and apply those to extra paid vacation days. We also use an employee recognition tool that lets managers and employees recognize others for going above and beyond. It's surprising how well most people respond to a simple thank-you. They respond even more strongly (most of the time) to a thank-you that comes with a little reward attached. (Check out the employee recognition tool we use at: [https://www.qarrot.com/](https://www.qarrot.com/)\n\n  \nHopefully, these thoughts are helpful. You can't always avoid working outside of regular work hours, especially when you're a smaller or earlier-stage company.", "timestamp": "2025-09-05T18:26:26Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Should we adopt France’s “no work calls after 6pm” rule?

{"id": "ncdpful", "text": "&gt;I was recently reading about France’s “right to disconnect” law, which basically makes it illegal for employers to call or email employees after a certain hour (often 6pm) unless it’s an emergency.\n\nThat is not how the French \"right to disconnect\" law works. It esbtalishes no rules about when work can be done. Instead it requires *employers* to establish some kind of agreement with, or charter for, their employees that defines what \"right to disconnect\" looks like in their company. That way, companies can take into account things like emergency work, late night shifts, and working across multiple time zones.\n\nDo I think this policy would improve work-life balance as actually written in French law? Not really. I live in the U.S. and many companies pay lip service to this - that they want you to have good work-life balance, that you don't have to respond to any mails when you're not working, etc. My company has encouraged orgs to write 'team agreements' about what hybrid work looks like and what core working hours are; in my experience it really changes nothing about the team itself. Teams that want more work-life balance will write relaxed agreements and continue working the way they always have. Teams that expect you to dedicate your life to the job write their agreements more carefully, in a way that *looks* like they embrace flexibility and downtime on face but really exist primarily as a CYA document. (In one of my previous roles, I had to write one of these.) The real expectations are communicated verbally and through modeling. \n\nThe law as written allows companies to write in exceptions for urgent issues, so no issues there.\n\nI'm going to treat #3 as a question of happiness rather than loyalty. I think most people would be happier at companies they can truly disconnect from and recharge after hours and on weekends. Even when I do *choose* to work on a weekend or after hours, I rarely want to actually talk to anyone, and I don't expect people to answer me at those hours. The past jobs I have enjoyed the most and stayed with the longest were definitely the ones where work didn't creep into my after hours.", "timestamp": "2025-09-04T14:34:28Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Should we adopt France’s “no work calls after 6pm” rule?
