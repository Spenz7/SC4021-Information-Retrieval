It uses million dollar ai to stack bundles of books on a pallet in a certain order. Before the robot it was a one man job that took a long time. Now it's a 5 man job that takes minutes. You have the stacker who watches and maintains the bot. The mechanic who repairs the physical parts of the bot. The lead software engineer who writes up code and improves ai over time. The safety manager because bots are dangerous. Then the owner of said ai. The bot malfunctions a hundred times a day and it's mostly because the ai gets confused in it's patching and we have to reset and rezone it. Ai is not why ai doesn't work. Ai doesn't work because you need some kind of human sense being touch, sound, or sight. Eyes for bots are infamous for being unreliable, touch based bots constantly have to be dialed in and coordinated, and sound based is affected by simple things like air density and dust particles. In your case I doubt a bot could compare things based on worth unless you manually program every single item.

{"id": "jlvvb92", "text": "This is a great question and one that’s surely worth considering. However, I agree with the majority of responses here - I don’t believe it’s an immediate threat. \n\nI do, however, want to touch on your statement regarding discrimination. First, AI/ML has shown to be considerably bias in decision making. The spectrum of bias broad, based on a variety of elements but namely the learning model that was used to train the algorithm. While AI is great at identifying patterns and executing complex processes far faster than any human, it’s important for any organization that’s considering using AI for decision making to remember that ML algorithms are developed and trained by humans and, therefore, are not perfect. Recent research on this topic has brought much attention to it and many leading AI developers are working to reduce and mitigate this bias as much as possible. \n\nThe DOL very recently released a Q&amp;A/recommendation letter that addressed this very specific topic, specifically related to companies relying on AI to help with hiring decisions. Interestingly, while they acknowledged that bias by AI certainly exists in these processes, they didn’t take a hard stance against it. Instead, they encouraged employers to work with their respective AI platform to ensure the ML algorithms are designed to mitigate bias as much as possible. They briefly discussed the two leading methods for identifying bias (4/5ths rule and statistical significance) but did not directly indicate which method they would apply to such claims and charges. \n\nAI is a tool used to (hopefully) help make better and faster business decisions. However, companies are ultimately responsible for all employment practices and actions they take, including fair and ethical hiring. While AI is a hot topic in the HR sphere right now, it’s imperative that employers fully understand how it works before implementing practices involving AI that have the opportunity to impact employment outcomes.", "timestamp": "2023-05-28T00:15:38Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Is compensation analysis going to be yet another job that's taken over by AI?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/13t4928/is_compensation_analysis_going_to_be_yet_another/"}}
