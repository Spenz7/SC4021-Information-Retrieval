{"id": "n9my2q5", "text": "This is actually brilliant - you're seeing someone who can execute vs just talk about potential.

{"id": "n9r5rbj", "text": "Honestly bro, I’d be impressed ngl. Most juniors all look copy-paste on paper, so seeing actual work is refreshing. A simulation portfolio shows initiative, they built it without being asked, that’s a green flag. No, it’s not the same as a real internship, but it shows how they think and execute. I’d weigh it like a strong skills test, not the whole story, but definitely signal.If nothing else, it gives you talking points in an interview beyond “tell me about college.” Future or gimmick? Depends if more grads start doing it.
