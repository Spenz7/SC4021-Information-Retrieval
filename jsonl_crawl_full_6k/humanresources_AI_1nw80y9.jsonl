If you're not talking about HR in a strategic way, you should be. If you're not demonstrating value in your job, you're doing it wrong. HR oversees the most expensive asset in any company, the people. HR has a ton of sway with senior leadership and is apart of senior leadership at every company I've worked at. Stop acting like all HR does is admin work.\n\nAutomation and integration is the area in which HR has the most room for improvement, in terms of technology. This will probably affect some admin, coordinator and other entry level positions negatively, but that's not new. Payroll used to be an extremely manual process and required a large team. Now, with payroll tools, payroll admins can handle much higher volumes per person. \n\nAI is a tool and it should be used as such. We should be very, very wary of using it for things like compensation, recruiting and trainings. AI has been discriminatory, gives illegal advice and makes stuff up. Giving AI access to sensitive employee information is something companies need to be careful about. Some cities/states/countries have already banned use of AI in certain HR areas.\n\nFor recruiting specifically, AI resume screening can be hit or miss and is easily gamed by candidates right now.

{"id": "nhhdn1h", "text": "I think both sides are going to use AI to their advantage, candidates and employers. The people who embrace it early will get ahead faster, but the pendulum will swing back and forth. Companies will over-automate and annoy people, candidates will figure out how to game the system, and then things will rebalance.\n\nWe run AI voice interviews for recruiting teams, and what's been fascinating is how different the reality is from the perception. At first glance, people think it's dystopian or impersonal. But when you're applying to 50 jobs and hearing back from maybe 3, suddenly an instant interview on your own time feels like a relief. An empathetic AI can be so much more energizing than a burned out recruiter. I remember making 100 calls a day in my staffing days and I know the first 10 calls I made were way better and enthusiastic than the last 90.  \n  \nCandidates actually like AI because it cuts through the hopelessness of the endless job search. Recruiters like it because they don't waste time on basic prescreens and can focus on quick responses at the end of the funnel. Instead of a month long process, hiring can happen in under a week.\n\nWhat's really happening is AI is fixing parts of the process humans already broke. Ghosting, endless form-filling, bias, and scheduling headaches. For tradespeople or shift workers, being able to take an interview after working hours or on the weekend is game changing. For recruiters, it means more time spent on genuine conversations with qualified candidates instead of burning hours on repetitive admin (especially now with AI job applications).\n\nI think the end game of AI in HR is Candidates will tell their \"agent\" they're ready for a job search, employer agents will vet and negotiate, and humans will just do a quick final interview with 3-4 companies. What used to take months could be condensed into a week.\n\nThis shift is not just anecdotal. A recent study with 53,000 applicants randomized into AI-led vs. human-led interviews found:  \n\\+12% more job offers  \n\\+18% more job starts  \n\\+17% higher 30-day retention  \nAnd when given the choice, 78% actually chose the AI interviewer\n\nPaper here if curious: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MLZ\\_3hnWxr1J2wvosMWHs-f5IBCN8Coy/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MLZ_3hnWxr1J2wvosMWHs-f5IBCN8Coy/view)", "timestamp": "2025-10-03T03:06:46Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "IS AI is going to eliminate HR jobs… or finally prove HR’s value?

En revanche, cela devrait libérer du temps afin que les équipes RH puissent se concentrer davantage sur les personnes, pratiquer l’empathie, etc.\n\nJe partage plutôt ce point de vue. Il existe encore trop de tâches profondément humaines dans les RH qui ne pourront pas, à court ou moyen terme, être remplacées. Les chatbots, par exemple, ne peuvent pas gérer efficacement une discussion sur une transition de carrière, car la dimension émotionnelle y est trop importante.
