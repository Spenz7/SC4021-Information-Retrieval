{"id": "mh0r5ew", "text": "In the US: A *job analysis* has to be performed for a [full legally compliant job under the EEOC](https://www.uniformguidelines.com/uniformguidelines.html) description: This involves interviews, panels, supervisory assessment, questionnaires, and live observation assessments of the **specific job** with the **specific tasks** at the **specific company**.\n\nAn AI writing a job description can insert \"*expected to lift 15 lbs frequently*\" as an AR/AP Rep (because that is what the AI learned from its data set and was the most common). However, the mere inclusion of \"*May occasionally be required to lift 30 lbs*\" is the difference between compliance and a six-figure settlement ($$$). Live assessment of this is key to see what items are being lifted? What's the weight? How about the fact the employee would be under video surveillance 5 days a week for months at a time to see how frequent this happens? Sure you can try to have some form of video AI assessing this, but that is entirely impractical to roll out for every single company and every single job to be compliant.\n\nSimilarly, the employer argued this was *required* for this position and not an optional task - which is the difference between a \"key essential function\" as defined by the EEOC and an \"other function\" that can be assigned to someone else in an ADA accommodation.\n\nA lot of these generic job description writing tools give people a starting point, but still expose them to legal and liability risk (the argument of augmentation vs automation). The generic job description that was used as a boiler plate wasn't enough to defend said client from a lawsuit because the EEOC stated a proper job analysis was not performed. But the companies pitching these \"AI job description writing\" products won't tell their customer base about those risks of course.", "timestamp": "2025-03-10T13:43:43Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "HR Professionals, do you fear AI replacing your job?
