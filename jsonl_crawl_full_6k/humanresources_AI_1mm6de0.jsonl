The admin stuff you mentioned is just the tip of the iceberg honestly.\n\n\n\nWhat we're seeing work really well is AI handling the truly painful parts - like automatically parsing resumes in different languages and formats, matching skills across different certification systems (German apprenticeships vs US trade schools etc), and most importantly, navigating all the visa/work permit requirements automatically. That last part alone saves our clients like 15-20 hours per placement.\n\n\n\nThe interview notes thing is pretty solid already with tools like Otter or even just ChatGPT for cleanup. But where it gets interesting is when you start using AI to actually pre-screen candidates based on specific criteria, especially for roles where you're dealing with language barriers or different qualification standards.\n\n\n\nOne thing I'd be careful about though - the \"full blown AI agents\" are mostly still pretty overhyped. Most of them work great for simple, repetitive tasks but fall apart when you need nuanced decision making or when dealing with edge cases. We've found the sweet spot is using AI to handle the heavy lifting on data processing and initial screening, but keeping humans in the loop for anything that involves judgment calls.\n\n\n\nFor international stuff specifically, AI is honestly a necessity at this point because the compliance requirements change so frequently that no human can keep track of everything across multiple countries.
