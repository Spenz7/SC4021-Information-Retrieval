{"id": "fpsqc42", "text": "When it comes to elevating talent from emerging markets - or really anywhere in the organization - having a strong assessment process for identifying people with leadership potential is key.  The current leading practice to do this is to leverage behavioral science based assessments.  This method reduces bias and helps to identify hidden talent in the organization.  Then, once that talent is identified, having a holistic development program that selects employees for leadership roles and helps coach the person through gap closure is key.  Today, we are finding that all leaders need skills in what we call positive leadership -  growth mindset, resilience, engagement &amp; inclusion, trust &amp; transparency, and agility - and these are the exact skills/behaviors that leaders often need to build.

It can also be used to support personalized, just-in-time learning and skilling which are key factors in engagement.  Thankfully, all of this is already part of IBM's culture so there was not a need to change our remote working policy.

{"id": "fpys5p8", "text": "Thanks for the AMA.\n\nThere's probably hundreds of takeaways from this discussion, but I do feel that one key going forward has to be building a more robust and adaptable resource management paradigm that proactively embraces interdepartmental and small-group needs.\n\nTechnology has already become so much a part of our work life that one has to address very specific and actionable elements in order to remain relevant. New opportunities, often in the form of crises, arise unpredictably and organizations need to be mobile and flexible enough to respond and adapt -- notice for instance the exponential rise of Zoom in the past few months, something probably not foreseeable even a year ago.  (Doubling its market value and likely rendering it a tasty prospective target for Google, perhaps.)\n\nHR always needs to remain cognizant of its role to be in service to specific organizational and departmental needs, but to otherwise maintain its appropriate background role, while reinforcing requisite ties with legal and regulatory departments in regards to complex, ever-changing, and often contradictory employment laws across global jurisdictions.\n\nWork-at-home is certainly a huge issue in the current time frame, of course, and HR needs to be cognizant of the dangers of the central organization encroaching upon workers' non-work lives, a far greater danger than the opposite that organizations usually seem concerned about (decrease in the ability to micromanage it what this concern often camouflages.)  Questions may be raised, at some point, about the dividing line between employee and independent contractor, when many more employees can now control their own schedules to a greater degree.\n\nLarger organizations may even be able to strike a balance between work in office and remote work, by providing the equivalent of coworking spaces or minimally-equipped satellite offices, where remote work or \"work at home\" employees could have access to basic requirements (desk, supplies, fax/copier, high-speed connections, etc.) , closer to their homes, in a more widely spaced out interior plan (for social distancing) and with relatively lower overhead than the official corporate office.", "timestamp": "2020-05-09T07:14:51Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "I'm Amy Wright, Managing Partner for Talent ＆ Transformation at IBM.
