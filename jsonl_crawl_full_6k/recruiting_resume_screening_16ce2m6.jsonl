Failing to mention he’s never hired one of them in 10 years\n\nMiraculously recruiter fines unicorn candidate Who meets the requirements of the position.\n\nRecruiter sells first born child in order to meet the requirements of the candidate\n\nRecruiter sends candidate to the manager, And manager says “ Well this candidate is at the top end of the pay band. I was really hoping you could find somebody at the lower end. I don’t know if I actually have the budget for that”\n\nRecruiter walks to the nearest bridge And violently throws himself off the side… But his boss is waiting at the bottom to save him and yell at him for being so lazy\n\nManager calls three weeks later, realizing This is a once in a lifetime candidate so he should probably talk to them. (Meanwhile recruiter is slamming his head against the desk thinking “ No shit, that’s what I told you three weeks ago”)\n\nRecruiter Calls candidate back up. Candidate says since I put my résumé together for you I figured I would send it out to a few other people and I have 37 other job offers now. All are substantially more than you are offering. I can’t believe I ever trusted you in the first place you scum of the earth\n\n\nRecruiter calls manager And says I talked with the candidate. Can we get together for lunch to discuss? Actually builds a relationship with the manager, And starts getting legitimate requirements.\n\nManager starts referring this recruiter to all of his friends (Were they once again have to walk through glass at first)\n\n**** That my friends is the life of an agency recruiter.
