{"id": "nj1k7v8", "text": "Several years ago I was hiring for a Logistics position for the project engineering company I worked for.  HR filtered most of the resumes and brought me just the top 10.

As an international firm who sourced globally, for us this could be an advantage. \n\nThe kicker is a few days later my HR liaison guy came to me and showed me a resume from their historical database, where they kept the resumes from all previous applicants.  It showed the exact same applicant applying for an accounting position and he also listed 20 years of progressive experience, covering the identical dates as for the Logistics position - but they were all accounting roles. \n\nWe both had a good laugh over that one.", "timestamp": "2025-10-12T02:42:31Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Just when I think I've seen it all - I get this resume [n/a]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1o0efyg/just_when_i_think_ive_seen_it_all_i_get_this/"}}
