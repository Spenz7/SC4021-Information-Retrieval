{"id": "nl46hpk", "text": "Yeah, this is becoming more common across recruiting.\n\nAI has completely changed the power balance as candidates are using it to level the field. Before, recruiters had the advantage of process knowledge and keyword filters; now AI tools are coaching candidates step by step.\n\nIt starts with small things like polishing resumes to mirror job descriptions and bypass ATS filters but it’s now moved into interviews. Some candidates use AI listening tools that feed them real-time responses, and a few even use avatars or proxy interviewers. It’s wild, but it’s happening everywhere.\n\nThe best way to spot it isn’t more tech , it’s more human conversation. Drop the scripted “Where do you see yourself in five years?” type questions. Instead, ask open questions about specific problems they solved, how they handled setbacks, or how they’d approach a scenario. Follow up naturally, like you’re chatting over coffee.\n\nYou’ll notice when someone’s truly thinking  versus when they’re just repeating a polished, machine-fed answer.\n\nUntil recruiters catch up to this, it’ll probably keep getting worse but those who focus on authenticity and real dialogue will always see through it faster than any algorithm.", "timestamp": "2025-10-24T11:04:57Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Candidates using AI tools during interview..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1oec07f/candidates_using_ai_tools_during_interview/"}}
