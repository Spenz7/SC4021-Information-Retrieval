{"id": "kz8fyfa", "text": "&gt;he’s telling me he wants to review every single resume before we screen or interview\n\nYou could try approaching it from a angle of saving him time and effort. If the boss of a 600 employee organization is reviewing every single resume prior to a screening interview, that seems like a poor use of time. I'll paraphrase Mark Horstman (of [Manager Tools](https://www.manager-tools.com/)): Managerial economics 101 says that the cheapest person who is able to do a task at the acceptable level of quality is the person who should do that task. If the CEO's time is worth 3x per hour and your time is worth x per hour, why the heck should the company pay 3x to get a task done when it could pay x instead? It is basic delegation.\n\n\"Hey boss, let's see if you we can get me to understand the filtering criteria that you are using when you look at these resumes. If I'm able to apply that criteria consistently, then you won't have to spend time looking over these resumes prior to an HR phone screen.\"", "timestamp": "2024-04-12T13:57:34Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Owner says “HR is not Legal”.
