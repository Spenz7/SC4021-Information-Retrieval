{"id": "nt625m3", "text": "I’m not a recruiter, but I’ve been a hiring manager and just wrapped up a job search myself. So my favorite questions are more relevant in the HM interview context than in phone screen interview, but I love giving candidates a chance to both brag and vent, in a (mostly) unscripted manner. \n\nA question set in this vein that I was asked in one of my interviews was “if I were to gather the people you’ve worked with most closely throughout your career, what would they say is favorite/most enjoyable aspect of working with you?” Followed up with “what would they say is **your** favorite aspect of this type of work?” And finally he asked “what would they say is the thing that frustrates **you** the most?” \n\nI’ll be repurposing those questions in future interviews. One I always like to ask is “whats something you want me to know that I CANT discern from reading your resume?” and somewhat related, “can you tell about your proudest moment in your career? / most fulfilling moment?” \n\nI’m trying to get some personality out of them, to get a feel for it, which is maybe different than what recruiters are trying to achieve during their part of the process. But because they’ve been vetted by recruiters and usually another team member by the time I interview them, I’m pretty sure they can at least do the job from a competence POV, and I want to see what they’d be like to work with on a daily basis, how they think, and how they communicate their thoughts. So I try to focus my interviews in that direction. So when I ask these, I make sure to engage like a normal human having a conversation, and will ask follow up questions about whatever their answer is. Make it feel casual enough be comfortable being less filtered. \n\nI find that there’s a bit of an art to establishing a rapport in a short period of time, enough that a candidate will relax a little and let their guard down enough to talk like a regular human. It’s served me pretty well as far as making good hires goes.\n\nETA: And this may be specific to the line of work I’m in (financial crimes investigations) but the X factor that I hire for is natural curiosity, because I can teach you every technical skill that you need, but I can’t teach curiosity.

{"id": "nt5w3ld", "text": "I guess things are different here in America. It works very well for me and I don't exactly recruit kids but lots of new grads and people with 3-5 years of experience. \n\nAnd you have to remember it's a casual conversation. Most of my conversations start out with pleasantries and then maybe something that's not even work-related to kind of keep them off guard. Then slowly work through their background, their desires, \"what they want to be when they grow up,\" etc. \n\nWith these notetakers I can be even more involved in the conversation because I'm not writing notes as I'm talking. I'm letting the notetaker do all the recording and then I go back and fill in my data sheet and put together my interview summary for my clients. \n\nLast night is a good example. One of the guys on my team set up a three-way call between me, him, and a candidate that we were going to send out for a project management role for a construction company. After the call I hung up and then my teammate called me back and he said, \"Man, you make it look so easy. You got him to tell you everything and lots of times he just told you without you having to ask.\"\n\nAnd that's the key. It's like I'm talking to a friend and I'm gathering all the information that I need to be able to successfully present him to my client and know everything about him and his background. Too many recruiters treat interviews like interrogations and I treat them like I just met the guy at a bar and we're having a drink or in your case a pint, and I'm just asking him about himself because people love to talk about themselves in most cases. If you can come across to be very genuine and not like you're interrogating or interviewing them even though you are, it works out really well.", "timestamp": "2025-12-09T19:34:03Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Recruiters: What's your secret question to instantly spot soft-skill red flags?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1pi747f/recruiters_whats_your_secret_question_to/"}}

{"id": "nt5wxns", "text": "It really depends. Someone else had called me out on this and what you have to understand is that all my interviews are very conversational in nature. I treat them like I just met you in a bar and we're having a conversation about yourself.\n\nToo many recruiters treat them like interrogations. Do I use \"what do you want to be when you grow up\" when I'm talking to a 50-year-old CFO? Of course not. But a lot of the candidates that interview are new grads, are people with 3-5 years' experience, and if the conversation is going well, it's something that I can ask with a laugh. It's more like \"where do you want to see yourself for the next 3-5 or 7 years?\" What are your aspirations? Do you want to be in sales? Do you want to be a sales manager? Do you want to be an engineering manager? Do you want to be a vice president, etc.? And I ask it in a way that's kind of funny without interrogating them.\n\nThat's what a lot of recruiters don't do. They treat interviews like hard-core interviews when as a headhunter you should be treating it like a casual conversation. Make the person you're talking to feel comfortable when he's being interviewed.", "timestamp": "2025-12-09T19:38:12Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Recruiters: What's your secret question to instantly spot soft-skill red flags?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1pi747f/recruiters_whats_your_secret_question_to/"}}
