It’s sad not because they don’t have the experience but it’s because someone out there also decided not to hire them for those jobs to get the experience to put on their resume. Resumes only list jobs which a person was offered. They don’t list the jobs the person COULD do or WANTS to do. And AI and key words are simply not able to move these kinds of candidates forward.

{"id": "nljk46t", "text": "I think you’re misdiagnosing the problem. To me, it sounds like the real problem here is that you’re imposing excessive and unreasonable expectations on your candidates. Interviews are extremely stressful, especially in our current economy where the entire world feels like it’s falling apart and we’re on the brink of World War III. You can’t reasonably expect anybody to be relaxed under these circumstances. Also, the way someone responds to stress in an interview is completely different from the way they respond to stress on the job. When someone is job hunting, they are in a position without economic security, which automatically makes them more stressed out then they will ever be on the job. You shouldn’t be testing for “emotional intelligence” or personality types, anyway. That’s Social Darwinism, which is just a skip and a hop away from eugenics, fascism, and ethnic cleansing. (Real Darwinism is the opposite of Social Darwinism). The only thing you should be testing for is technical ability to do the job. You need to allow candidates to have low or non-existent EQ. Stop testing for it.\n\nThere’s a book I think you ought to read titled *Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us* by Daniel H. Pink which explains that workers only produce their best work when they’re being paid enough that they feel economically secure and aren’t thinking about money. What this means during the interview process is that you will never see a candidate’s best work during an interview because the economic insecurity of being jobless makes them mentally incapable of doing their best work or showing how they’ll actually perform on the job.\n\nEDIT: Here's another post from a Reddit user looking for a job that highlights why your methodology is flawed:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/InterviewCoderPro/s/CHYxtWHlEO", "timestamp": "2025-10-26T21:07:23Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "I'm Tired of Interviewing People Who Are Great at Applying for Jobs, But Terrible at Doing Them.[N/A]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1oe8him/im_tired_of_interviewing_people_who_are_great_at/"}}

Over the past few months, I’ve been interviewing actively, and while I do have the technical capability and relevant experience, the pressure in these situations is real. Getting an interview itself is difficult in the current market, so every conversation feels “high stakes.” That pressure can cause even capable people to fumble or overthink in the moment.\n\n\nIt’s not always a lack of skill or EQ — sometimes it’s simply the anxiety of knowing that one imperfect answer could close the door. I completely understand the need to assess composure, communication, and collaboration. Those matter. But I think we might get a more accurate read on candidates if we also recognize the emotional context they’re navigating.\n\n\nIf we create interview structures that are a little less performative and a little more like real problem-solving conversations, I believe we’d see more of a candidate’s true capability — and not just how well they perform under artificial interview stress.", "timestamp": "2025-10-29T21:47:49Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "I'm Tired of Interviewing People Who Are Great at Applying for Jobs, But Terrible at Doing Them.[N/A]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1oe8him/im_tired_of_interviewing_people_who_are_great_at/"}}

{"id": "no3f8j4", "text": "This perfectly sums up why the human element in hiring is irreplaceable. An ATS can screen for credentials, but it can’t interpret emotional intelligence, adaptability, or the nuances of human behavior  only a skilled recruiter can.\n\nAnd as much as organizations are leveraging AI, candidates are doing the same. Optimized résumés and keyword strategies can easily make an average profile look exceptional on paper. That’s exactly why the role of experienced recruiters and talent partners has never been more critical.\n\nHere’s how we can address this gap in our hiring framework:\n\n1. Human-led pre-assessments: Before any formal round, we prioritize brief, structured conversations to gauge self-awareness, curiosity, and communication tone things no AI can quantify.\n\n2. Scenario-driven interviews: Instead of rehearsed Q&amp;As, we use contextual “day-in-the-role” situations. It helps reveal how candidates think, react, and collaborate under realistic pressure.\n\n3. Collaborative evaluation: We include team members from different functions in early interviews. This brings balanced judgment and helps identify cultural or behavioral red flags early on.\n\nTechnology can make hiring faster, but it’s the human insight that makes it smarter. The best hiring outcomes still come from pairing data-driven efficiency with recruiter intuition and empathy.", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T12:19:04Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "I'm Tired of Interviewing People Who Are Great at Applying for Jobs, But Terrible at Doing Them.[N/A]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1oe8him/im_tired_of_interviewing_people_who_are_great_at/"}}
