{"id": "ndbpszy", "text": "I think too many people are looking at this in a black and white way. AI will replace us all or not at all. That's not the best question to ask. The better question is, how will it change the landscape of recruiting, what will the recruiter's job look like in the future, and is that still a job you want to do?  \n  \nI was just part of a discussion on a recruiting Facebook group about this. I personally believe it may not eliminate recruiters, but it may dramatically reduce the number of recruiters necessary to support the collective hiring that is done by government and businesses. That doesn't even touch the idea that many of the professions we recruit could shrink as well. If, say, our businesses need 50% fewer accountants, they need even fewer recruiters (internal or external) to fill those roles.\n\nHow long could it take for this to happen if it happens? None of us really know. But the speed at which AI is gaining skill and ability is pretty insane.  \n\nThink about travel agents. Because of the internet, there was a 70% decline in the number of travel agents employed according to the BLS between 2000 and 2021.\n\nThe number of retail travel locations in the US dropped to 13,000, down from 34,000 in the mid-1990s.\n\nThat's a real example of a profession that was 70% displaced by technology. So, I do think it would not be in any recruiting professional's best interest to ignore or shrug off what is coming. \n\nIf some of us need or want to reinvent ourselves, having a plan B or C is not a bad idea.", "timestamp": "2025-09-09T20:06:43Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Yall think we will really be out of job soon cuz of AI?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1ncaaqu/yall_think_we_will_really_be_out_of_job_soon_cuz/"}}

Which goes back to my first point…. Those people really aren’t recruiting in the first place.\n\nThe example you gave was still very much relationship based.  Zuck was schmoozing and dining these folks for months if not longer.  Think about that.  Somebody with the most access to artificial intelligence in the planet understood that it was schmoozing these people they could get them to come over.  He didn’t anticipate they were going to randomly apply for jobs.  In my opinion, the massive amount of money he threw at them was due something outside of needing to give them that much.  It was a power move to show he was serious about future technology. I understand on this thread that Tek appears a much larger piece of recruiting than the real world too.
