{"id": "nt32et2", "text": "That's a great question. I see this question or just the general confusion around my office and in my team as well, here's a general overview, or rather my views on the subject:  \nChatGPT and other AI tools can do quite a bit beyond writing and editing in HR! For example,   \nyou can screen resumes by extracting key skills and matching them to your job requirements  \nit's a great way to generate interview questions tailored to specific roles or candidate profiles  \nAnalyze employee sentiment from feedback or survey data to spot trends  \nAutomate routine communications like scheduling interviews or sending reminders (this has been my personal favorite since I've started using Google Gemini)  \nSummarize lengthy policy documents or training materials for quick understanding (If you feel like it's TLDR, you can ask the AI to read it out loud for you as well)  \nHelp with onboarding by providing instant answers to new hires’ FAQs (This is something that came but I've personally never had to do because we already have an FAQ doc that is given to the new joiners)\n\nThese are just a few examples of what AI can help with in HR. It’s less about replacing tasks and more about making them faster. Once you know what’s possible, finding the right tools or prompts to get it done becomes easier!\n\nI hope that helps :)", "timestamp": "2025-12-09T09:07:15Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Other than writing and editing, how do you use ChatGPT or other AI in your HR work?

For example, I fed it a years worth of timecards and schedules asked it to analyze scheduling accuracy (how on-target are we between (a) the established schedule (b) what schedule was ACTUALLY worked and (c) how accurate our projections are) and it churned out an absolute pile of crap. It all Looked accurate which was the scariest thing, but if you did a random sample, you found that it just kind of made assumptions without asking, even when you asked it to document along the way.\n\nWe ended up building a model out to analyze this because it's something we want to do regularly, but I wanted to mention all this in case it's helpful.

Things like Power Automate that is a more obscure part of the suite could help frontline managers jump gaps you don't even know you have, but the challenge has always been the time-sink required to learn how to use it. With Co-Pilot there to troubleshoot, offer suggestions on it's own system, it's become incredibly accessible. Same with PowerApps, which I never went near because the learning curve was just so steep and I didn't have that kind of time. If you follow Ignite though, they just rolled out Vibe, which is pretty darn impressive and cuts out almost all of the technicalities of PowerApps in favor of a chat-based app-generation/edit format. \n\nThese are exactly the kind of use-cases AI excels at.
