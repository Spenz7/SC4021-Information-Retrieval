{"id": "jp4yx7n", "text": "Everything I'm about to say is anecdotal, but recently I worked for a company that was about 14K in headcount, 18 billion USD in revenue with a DEI team of 6. It was by far the largest DEI team I've worked with (I supported them mainly in analytics and reporting), and they were incredibly sharp. They were professional, practiced the DEI values they preached, and were incredibly hard working.\n\nThis team focused on fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion mainly through our ERGs/BRGs. They also brilliantly laid out a plan to invest $1 mil into local trade programs for underrepresented racial minorities to develop a workforce from scratch to fill their niche technical roles. This team was always at the forefront of HR, always presenting slick decks, and they genuinely believed in their cause.\n\nHere's my issue: even though this is the best DEI team I've seen, they are truly middle management at best. Want to improve the culture? Marketing and communications did all the actual work to create materials and distribute. Want to build a new workforce? Talent Acquisition did all the hiring and networking with the trade programs. Want to ensure diverse talent is represented at all levels of the org? Talent Management already had a robust plan to do that long before DEI arrived, not to mention the various HRBPs who were factoring in DEI into their succession planning and org development. \n\nAnd when it came time to report on metrics? Well, none of the DEI metrics were owned by DEI alone. Hiring was all on TA, representation was all on TM, any issues with OFCCP compliance or EEOC concerns fell with a separate team that did HR compliance. Equity issues in pay were managed by Total Rewards. The DEI team was absolutely stuck to find any metrics or topics that they alone could say \"yes, we did that\". That's why I was helping them with reporting; they were lost on how to actually quantify their work.\n\nThe business justification for DEI has always been weak, but the pandemic and racial tensions of 2020 undoubtedly pushed many companies to get more into DEI. But what have they accomplished? What value have they added? No one can say, especially the DEI teams themselves. It's always \"we know we're doing well\" but they can't prove it. Their success depends on dozens of other teams. Many DEI teams have resorted to saying \"this is the right thing to do\" regardless of the financial cost and impossible to calculate ROI. I don't think they're speaking the same language as executive leadership, but for a while there's been an underlying fear that corporations must care about DEI or else. It's almost like they've invested because they're afraid of the financial impact that comes with consumer backlash if the company were ever to be outed for not caring about DEI.\n\nI can't see any company wanting to expand their DEI professionals in this economic climate. Maybe they'll hire one or two to ensure they've checked the box, but there's no room to expand. DEI professionals are all building programs, but they're all nice to haves. And when the economy slows down, nice to haves are not business critical.\n\nMaybe I'm pessimistic, but even my HR colleagues who are POC, women, disabled, etc. don't see or have strong enthusiasm for DEI. It's a nice sentiment, but these teams are not delivering any real value to employees or their employers. I'm a gay man myself and I can say that DEI at every company I worked at has done nothing for queer individuals. It seems many other diverse individuals share the same critical take as me: DEI has a much smaller role in companies than we were led to believe.", "timestamp": "2023-06-22T20:30:08Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "What areas of HR do you think are most high in demand vs oversaturated?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/14g909n/what_areas_of_hr_do_you_think_are_most_high_in/"}}
{"id": "jp7256f", "text": "Very good post and assessment and I could not agree more. Our company went through a tough time last year and the first thing we did? Not hire the head of the DEI after the last one left. Actually the position was cut. Not to mention that DEI is owned by many different departments and needs to be embedded in the organization in a different way than it is now. In a company of over 6,000 people, we have only 1 real DEI person in HR and that is in the US because it's the US.

{"id": "jpcy95r", "text": "I think DEI works best with companies that fall on either end of the headcount spectrum. In the smaller companies, they have more ownership of projects and goals because of the lack of size in the HR team. I don't think many small organizations are focused on DEI, though, because smaller companies tend to focus on other business aspects.\n\nOn the other side of the headcount spectrum, I think it is easier for DEI to demonstrate its value in a larger organization because of the size of that organization.  There is a reason a company like NBC Universal/Comcast would put a heavy emphasis on DEI.  On the one hand, the size of the organization makes it a little harder for DEI initiatives to be split up amongst the other HR functions.  On the other hand, companies of this size always have a bunch of different projects and partnerships that involve DEI.  I can attest to the latter because NBC's DEI team invited individuals from my company when we first partnered with them on a project.  But, aside from my anecdotal example, NBC Universal sponsored a number of initiatives around Indigenous films and script writing programs, and the DEI team was at the forefront of these initiatives.\n\nI do agree that there is little to no value in a company like in your example, as all the things a DEI team would do are already typically handled by other teams.", "timestamp": "2023-06-24T15:43:29Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "What areas of HR do you think are most high in demand vs oversaturated?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/14g909n/what_areas_of_hr_do_you_think_are_most_high_in/"}}
