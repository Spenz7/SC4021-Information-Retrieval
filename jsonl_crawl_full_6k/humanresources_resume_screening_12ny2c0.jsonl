{"id": "jgi7ypl", "text": "So a few projects I’ve been given were white papers, perfect attendance, DEI engagements and other confidential projects. Some are more engaging than others and the level of commitment depends entirely on the individual. I’ve seen some projects achieve the bare minimum and some go above and beyond expectations. These all have some sort of structure to them but there’s a lot of room for individuality. \n\nI’ve also worked on a few personal projects which has no structure to them. An example of this is during enrollment period I witnessed a lot of associates have confusion over what was being offered to them. I created a kind of ELI5 to make the process easier to encourage our associates to actually find what they need from insurance, retirement, etc. \n\nOn the point about how other organizations can encourage the same, I believe that comes down to culture. Generally at Amazon, innovation is encouraged, and that’s especially true at the site I work at. Projects and initiatives are part of our individual review, and the more impact it has on Amazon as a whole, the higher you will be rated. So in my opinion it starts with an organization that commits and fosters a culture for innovation. As long as you can align your project/initiative to the business I believe there’s a good chance that upper management will approve.", "timestamp": "2023-04-16T17:36:06Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "HR Partner at Amazon", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/12ny2c0/hr_partner_at_amazon/"}}

My first few months were regular standard administrative work, basically building your foundations. As time goes by more and more got added onto my plate, including ER concerns, projects, etc. Depending on how big your team is, will determine how much work you actually do. My team is pretty big so there isn't as much work to go around on a daily basis, so there are days when I have little to do. Normal days right now are, pulling metrics, meetings, handling ER concerns, planning DEI, audits, and whatever else is going on that day.\n\nMy advice would be to try and connect with your operations team, introduce yourself, and get comfortable meeting new people.
