Folks at my work, even my fellow managers, are using ChatGPT to make them sound more professional, more succinct, etc. for everything (it feels like); emails, IM responses, drafting memos. \n\nThe other day one of my coworkers was bragging to me about how easy it was and how much better her emails sound. She's got a few insecurities with her writers voice, since we work and communicate with primarily attorneys &amp; she is hyper-aware of the fact that she doesn't have thay same level of education. To be clear, her education serves her welp in her job and she's an INCREDIBLY savvy and smart person - I feel like the insecurities are unfounded, tbh. She is exceptionally kind and professional in her written correspondence, she doesn't see it that way, though, because she speaks how she talks and she does not talk like a lawyer.\n\nI usually help her draft something up if it's an important message/email - mainly proof reading and offering suggestions. But I know she hasn't been wanting to lean on me so heavily because folks in the office have commented things along the lines of \"wounded like [I] wrote it.\" So it makes sense to me that she'd at least try out ChatGPT, though I wasn't expecting the level of excitement when she said, \"That dang thing made me sound like you.\"\n\nI didn't know how to respond without hurting her feelings because I know that this is something she'sstruggled with in terms of self-esteem. Like... I was doing this type of technical writing in this field for YEARS before ChatGPT entered the scene. This is a learnable skill, one that I've been working to help her hone through my proofreading opportunities with her work. This is a skill that I want her, and everyone else on the planet, to have or at least have the opportunity to have. Especially since it is relatively easy once you get through the general learning curve; you write a rough draft, and come back later to revise and apply any changes.  \n\nI'm also worried that this is emblematic of larger, wide-spread issues and we're going to see a wave of people who cannot think critically about what they are writing either as they're writing it or upon reviewing and editing.", "timestamp": "2026-01-16T22:34:42Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "I've starting using AI to 'translate' my bluntness into HR corporate-speak and the results have been shocking.

{"id": "o08pnlz", "text": "I am retired military so I get cut some slack for being mission focused and not overly tactful when I think things are not moving towards the final desired result. I also have a sarcastic streak. And I have a weakness for typing exactly what I am thinking. I will have to give your AI idea a toss to see how it handles. My personal hack is that Outlooks autocorrects my abusing language into something less triggering.\n\n“Did you get it this time or should I type slower” becomes “We’ve had this conversation. I think a face-to-face meeting over a cup of coffee might help.”\n“Are you always this stupid or is today a special occasion” becomes “I really don’t think you’ve thought this through. I think a face-to-face meeting is a way we can make sure everyone understands what needs to happen”.\n\nCurse words have easy corrections also. \n\nThis allows me to vent. Outlook tones it down and the final draft is professional enough that the thin skinnned folks are no longer in danger.\n\nI actually like the AI idea because I have to update and revise the autocorrect from time to time.", "timestamp": "2026-01-18T05:10:17Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "I've starting using AI to 'translate' my bluntness into HR corporate-speak and the results have been shocking.
