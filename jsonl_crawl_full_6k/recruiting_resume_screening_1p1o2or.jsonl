First line of defense is that rectangle thing on your desk that you use to watch TikTok , also makes phone calls! You can actually make 50, 60, even 70 calls per day!  Pick up the phone and call the candidate, ask a few random questions, ask about their experience, make it a casual non-interview, interview so it’s more difficult to use AI. Build a r-r-r relationship with the candidate! Crazy, I know! You’ll have to look up from your printed list of canned pre-screen interview questions to do that last one though. If you know the industry you’re recruiting for, you’ll pick up their use of keywords, etc that shows they have the expertise. With recruiters afraid to pick up the phone, using AI to judge resumes, sending candidates through one-way AI judged virtual interviews, posting random evergreen job ads, etc are we really surprised that candidates are turning the tables on us? Heck, I’m also out here looking for a job right now and I have to apply to 100+ jobs/day only to get phone calls from the random insurance sales recruiters who felt it necessary to hide their commission sales job in job ads titled HR Rep, Recruiter, Talent Acquisition, etc. Long story short, be real, put the work in, stop relying on text and AI tools and you won’t have to worry about “handling fake candidates “.

The problem is there are so many fake LI profiles now as well that are flooding the search results. Even the ones that are ‘verified’ seem to be fake.\n\nMy method so far has been checking mutuals, activity (like posts), and checking the contact info button to see if it says verified by work email.” If I don’t get a strong signal from that, i do my best to assess if the content seems naturally written. \n\nIt definitely makes the sparse profiles less trustworthy, although I know a lot of people leave theirs blank. \n\nI wish there was a quicker way to validate these profiles.

{"id": "o0rnz8k", "text": "What frustrates me most is how convincing the profiles are now. CVs that match the role almost too well, LinkedIn profiles that look fine on their own, then you get on a call and realise something’s off. By then you’ve already lost the time.\n\nI got fed up spending time on manual checks every time, so I ended up building something small for myself to plug into Workable (our ATS). I called Flagable and have been testing it over the last few months. My team and I have caught a surprising number of candidates who would almost certainly would have made it to interview. Most of them didn’t look obviously fake until you started spotting patterns across applications.\n\nI don’t think there’s a silver bullet yet, but pushing some of that pattern-spotting earlier has helped a lot. Curious what others are doing. Also happy to share more on Flagable, if anyone is curious.", "timestamp": "2026-01-21T00:28:44Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "How are you handling the rise in fake candidates?

{"id": "nptvl6t", "text": "We started seeing this spike too around the same time.. the AI resumes are getting scary good. One thing that's been catching them early for us - we ask candidates to record a quick 60-second video intro explaining why they're interested in the role. The fake ones either ghost immediately or send something that's clearly off (wrong accent, doesn't match their supposed background, etc).
