What worked with referrals and gut-checks breaks when the volume hits that level.\n\nIf you don’t build a system, the system builds chaos. And right now, chaos = 1,000 résumés sitting like an anchor on your desk.\n\n**What to do first (before tools):**\n\n* Write down the 3–5 *non-negotiables* for the role. Hard filters. Not “nice to haves.” If you don’t define these, no tool will save you.\n* Turn those into *binary screeners*: Yes/No questions you can map directly from a résumé (years of experience in X, certification Y, location Z).\n\n**Now, about AI:**  \nMost “AI resume tools” are just fancy keyword matchers. If you’re not careful, they’ll automate bias faster than you can blink. The legal risk (like the Workday lawsuit you mentioned) usually comes when the filters are hidden, inconsistent, or discriminatory. Transparency and documentation is your shield.\n\n* Use AI to **summarize, cluster, and highlight**—not to “decide.” Example: have AI group résumés into tiers (matches all 5 non-negotiables, matches 3–4, matches &lt;3).\n* Keep the final cut human. That human judgment layer is what protects you legally and ethically.\n\n**The process I’ve seen work best at small companies we've built solutions for:**\n\n1. Intake form or quick assessment linked to the posting (this filters out people who shotgun apply).\n2. AI helps organize/summarize responses into buckets.\n3. Hiring manager reviews only the “strong match” bucket, not all 1,000.\n\nThat way, you’re not outsourcing judgment—you’re outsourcing *sorting*.\n\nLast thing: don’t underestimate the power of friction. A 3-minute skills screener at application can cut your applicant pool in half, and the half that remains is 10x more serious.\n\nDo you want speed (fewer résumés to slog through) or do you want precision (higher quality shortlists)?
