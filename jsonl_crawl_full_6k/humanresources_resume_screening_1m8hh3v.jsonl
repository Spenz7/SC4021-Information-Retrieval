This one is a GAME CHANGER.)\n\nCTRL + HOME key = highlight text between where your text cursor is and the LEFTmost spot\n\nCTRL + END key = highlight text between where your text cursor is and the RIGHTMOST spot\n\nALT + F4 = close current window (e.g. closing a PDF after confirming what the contents are before you rename it)\n\nALT + TAB = switch windows/programs. Tip: hold ALT and tap Tab to toggle/cycle through the different windows you have open \n\nALT + SHIFT + TAB = same as the previous but you cycle backwards through windows\n\nThis is all I can remember off the top of my head.

Daughter’s in the hospital, dog died, pipe in apartment burst, anything you can think of. They then ask to reschedule; I give them the benefit of the doubt (even though I know what they’re doing), and then on the day of the reschedule, they ghost me. Sometimes people ghost on the first interview. It’s a flawed system. \n\nAll in all, I can feel my brain melting in real-time whenever I go through resumes.

{"id": "n5s0zeq", "text": "It is so easy these days to just put the resume into the ATS, and take a \"standard\" resume out of that ATS.
