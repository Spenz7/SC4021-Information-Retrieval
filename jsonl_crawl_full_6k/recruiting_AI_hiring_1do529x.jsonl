If I learned anything from my years working in the industry, I think people still need to focus on the human audience.\n\nIt’s people, generally a recruiter then a hiring manager, who are doing the final read before deciding to do a phone screen / first interview.\n\nThe existing search technology is just simple to complex booleans - in other words, keywords in and keywords out. The user searches for specific terms and if those terms are in your resume, huzzah, you’re in the search results.\n\nThis is the stage where they want machine learning processes to grind until it’s able to, theoretically, perform better searches than a human recruiter, even one that knows exactly what to search for. This is a bit of a tin foil hat, but I suspect one of the reasons companies outside of the staffing industry are posting fake jobs is for the purpose of collecting resumes to feed into chatgpt. It’s alarming and disruptive because other industries are doing it, but the reality is staffing industry has engaged in this behavior for a long time.\n\nBut turning up in a search has already been a challenge for applicants in the last decade too, as the big companies have adopted modern ATS software, and the smaller ones have moved off Excel/Word. These observations about tailoring resumes perfectly for the job description based on keywords are not new.\n\nAt the end of the day, no business owner is making a hiring decision without primarily human input.

Rejected a candidate that had a *ton* of experience, great soft skills, solid technical acumen, and would've probably been able to hit the ground running pretty quick. Problem was, this was a BI Analyst role and he was looking to cross train and break into Dev (we didn't need Devs, we needed Analysts) and had ambition to be a Director of Analytics in the next 5-10 years. We were a small company that didn't have Director level positions, so quite simply, this was someone that was looking to move up or move out very quickly and we thought there was a high risk he would be looking to get out of the department or the company in 1-2 years. \n\nInstead we went with someone who had no experience with our tools but solid fundamentals, equally great soft skills, and who was looking to really still up into the position we had. Less of a headache, will probably stay longer, and for reasons other than just pure technical skills was our \"more qualified\" candidate. \n\nIf the person we rejected was on Reddit I'm sure they'd be bitching up a storm about how these idiots let a \"perfect\" candidate like him go without realizing things like \"do the candidate's goals align with our own?\" is part of how people are evaluated. \n\nFWIW, we don't always go in this direction. I had a lot of experience, good technical skill, and was ambitious and wanting to learn...but I had come from big companies with silos and was specifically looking for a job that would give me a variety of tasks and where I'd get to wear a lot of hats, and was open to feedback and new ideas. Those aspects very much aligned with their goals, and that's why they picked me.

The problem is that when there are hundreds of candidates, the talent acquisition manager will typically review the top-ranked ones first and might close the position without looking at the bottom ones. If there is discrimination in the HireVue score, candidates get rejected because of bias, and no one is taking accountability.
