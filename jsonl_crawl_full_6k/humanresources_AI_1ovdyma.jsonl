{"id": "noi82jl", "text": "I agree. There's a big difference between outsourcing all your thinking to a tool or using the tool for non-value added tasks than using it to enhance or assist the work. By outsourcing Slack messaging to the bot, you are effectively making everything less efficient and training away your communication skills. They will atrophy. When I see that, I immediately think what will the employee do in a client meeting or when asked something impromptu without the ability to use AI.\n\nWhat I've come to the conclusion of is that AI benefits can be measured on the same bell curve as performance. Those high performers who have strong domain knowledge and experience use it for efficiencies sake and to enhance their tasks. The average typically like to outsource the work that they deem less than valuable or automate time-wasters. The underperformers? Well, they just turn in the AI's work and hope that no one's any the wiser. We are. But still, on paper, it looks like they are performing better.\n\nThe same can be said about performance in specific areas. If you have confident communicators, they tend to only use AI to make things more concise or understandable. Perhaps tailor it to a lay audience. If the communicator is self-conscious and/or lacks strong skills in that area, there is more of a chance that they will attempt to use AI to cover up that weakness. It becomes a crutch.
