Review here: [https://vitr-technologies.odoo.com/r/Xwm](https://vitr-technologies.odoo.com/r/Xwm)\n\nKey points:\n\n- Maximum automation: Offers a speedy interface with AI-powered prompts and detailed, enriched candidate profiles. Excellent for quick, customised searches\n\n- Complements traditional recruitment: Specialises in engaging passive candidates, making up 37% of the workforce, thus broadening your talent pool without additional costs\n\n- Deep Search Capabilities: Utilises data from platforms like LinkedIn to provide in-depth search functionality. A free account from this can provide greater search functionality than specific paid LinkedIn accounts. Worth exploring just for this feature... \n\n- User Experience: Intuitive and simple to use with quick setup. No pushy sales, just effective recruitment at your fingertips.\n\n-C ost-Effectiveness: While it has a free version that’s quite capable, the paid subscriptions offer more features and collaborative tools.\n\n- Broad Application: Beyond recruitment, useful for business development, creating sales leads, and more.\n\nPotential Challenges: Relies on broad datasets and quality may be poor in some regions or industries. Conversion of identified candidates to employees remains a challenge.\n\nIn summary, PeopleGPT not only enhances recruitment strategies but also offers significant potential for business development.

For the interview co-pilot, it does note-taking, spots inconsistencies, and even suggests follow-up questions, basically makes it easier to manage every stage of recruitment without switching tabs constantly.\n5. **Zapier** – To automate repetitive tasks between apps, like syncing candidate info from emails to your CRM or ATS.\n\nWith these, you’ll probably reclaim a big chunk of your day.
