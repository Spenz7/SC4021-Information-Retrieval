I feel like I have more time to spend with family and recharge myself.\n\nThe company has been doing this for about 15 years, so getting work done in 4 days isn’t a problem. I work in HR, so managing projects and meeting deadlines isn’t an issue, and I’m not scrambling to get things done. We work 9.5-hour days, totaling 38 hours a week, which is similar to a full 5-day schedule. Honestly, it doesn’t feel much different from regular 8-hour days.\n\nOur employees are really happy with our work schedule as well as the work itself. The important thing to note is that we have a good working environment, and my company (about 115 employees) does care about the overall health of its employees, so people tend to stay long-term. About 10% of our employees have been here for almost 20 years, and the majority of the staff have been here for 7+ years.

We tracked everything possible: Individual and team performance goals (if below a certain level, further exploration identified the challenges, which were rarely not enough time), time management, challenges, time spent outside working hours, ability to adapt, workload, load balance within teams, bottlenecks or delays, satisfaction, etc. \n\n  \nWe collaborated with the pilot participants to redesign the team's workflow.

{"id": "n742ngi", "text": "First off CONGRATS on the courage and preparation it took to pitch the 4-day work week! Getting a “bring me a plan” is a major win, especially when the usual reaction is fear-based \"No.\" Sounds like you made a strong, data-driven case, and that matters.\n\nTo your questions:\n\n1. Have you successfully implemented a 4-day week or even proposed one?\nYes, I’ve proposed it before (in a logistics and biotech setting), and while full implementation didn’t happen right away, we were able to launch a pilot version tied to specific teams with measurable outcomes.\n\n2. How did you handle pushback on coverage and productivity?\nCoverage is the #1 objection (totally normal). What worked for us was offering staggered days off instead of everyone taking Fridays off. That ensured someone was always available. Also, we looked at output-based goals instead of hours logged. That framing helped shift the conversation from \"time spent\" to \"value delivered.\"\n\n3. What metrics did you track to prove it worked?\n\n+Time to fill and time to onboard (recruiting)\n\n+Cycle time per task/project\n\n+Internal response time (like Slack/email or system actions in Workday)\n\n+Employee satisfaction (pulse surveys)\n\n+Absenteeism &amp; sick days\n\n+Voluntary turnover\n\n\nWe also asked managers to track “dropped balls” or escalations due to coverage gaps which, during the pilot, were NONE!\n\n4. Did it help with retention and burnout?\nYes AND No. Burnout scores dropped (we measured via internal surveys), and we saw a noticeable increase in applications when we listed 4-day work weeks in job postings.\n\nThat said, one challenge was managing meeting overload; people tried to cram too much into four days. We had to coach teams on prioritization and asynchronous updates.\n\nHappy to share the pilot plan template we used if it’s helpful for you. You’re on the right track, just keep tying it back to business outcomes and build in clear feedback loops! \n\nGood luck and I'm honestly excited for YOU!", "timestamp": "2025-08-05T20:34:43Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "humanresources", "post_title": "Just pitched a 4‑day work week to my boss.

Tools like Workday should make this easier.   \n\\- Pilot phase: suggest a 3-6 month trial period to collect data on productivity and burnout.

But our start time can be anywhere from 2:00am to 8:00am with manager approval. We have a couple of people that love coming in early and knocking out a long workday before noon. \n\nWe also allow flexing hours to Friday so if you need half a day for your kids play you can just make it up the rest of the week, or pull Friday forward and take a long weekend. All it takes is your direct managers approval. Also additional remote time can be approved by the manager. \n\nOf the 20 engineers I manage I have never denied a request, and regularly encourage them to flex more time than they ask for, or finish a day remote if they took half a day already. \n\nTreating employees like this has paid huge dividends. Attrition is exceptionally low, burn out is rare, and it’s a huge recruiting tool. Particularly for mid level people who have kids. I had a job interview with a true unicorn this week with three young kids. When I mentioned out Flex Time policy you could see his eyes light up. \n\nWhen things have to be scheduled on Friday afternoon we really try to cut staff free and just managers attend.
