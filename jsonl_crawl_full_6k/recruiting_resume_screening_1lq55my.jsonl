You don’t reference that you wanted to end the call because they were not qualified. It’s that you couldn’t understand them. I think politely explaining that you’re having issues hearing them would cause them to adjust and speak more clearly. You could also say you have everything you need at the moment but may email them with follow ups if they wouldn’t mind. \n\nIn my experience, candidates typically block a half an hour for these conversations.
