Email, inmail, sms, and campaigns are tools that help and can make it easier and add value BUT you need to be comfortable on the phone and embrace cold calling when appropriate. \n2. Never take a no from a person that can't say yes. If you do not have access to the hiring manager and understand WHAT THEY want  and are told \"You must work with HR/TA\" find a better job/client\n3. This is a numbers game until you learn the skills BUT you won't learn the skills unless you have good numbers.\n\nTake-away for new recruiters\n\n\"Fail our way first\"/\"earn the right to do things your way\" meaning the training works. Follow it and you'll succeed in spite of yourself. Give it 90-120 days and do everything the training says. You will succeed. Maybe not a big biller BUT most firms have a decent training program that works. I used to work for an MRI franchise (started in 97) and I still use some of what I was taught from day one. \n\nAsk for help, reach out to other recruiters who are successful. Most of us will gladly give advice, help with issues, or point you in the right direction. I love helping new recruiters and do RAK's (random acts of kindness 4 days a week anytime after 4PM EST (have one today in  10 mins) \n\nFeel free to connect with me on LI &gt;!in/thomasalascio!&lt;", "timestamp": "2024-02-26T21:22:51Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "What happened to this sub?

[Here's the exchange.](https://imgur.com/dCaerrf) I redacted the name of the MOD, because it's not about the person, it's about the tight guard rails that stifle discussion in this sub-reddit, which then makes it less useful than it has the potential to be.\n\nEven in the above example, the way a question is answered for someone still has the potential to benefit other recruiters.
