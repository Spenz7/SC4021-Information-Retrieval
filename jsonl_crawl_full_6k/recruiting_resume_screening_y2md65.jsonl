But I can explain how we approached a large number of applications:\n\nIt's simply not possible to manage that number of applicants without using an ATS. The ATS itself does not filter candidates, it allows the recruiter at a glance to see how many new applicants thry have, and to move people through the process, ie once I screen a candidate I can move them to 'first round interview' designation.\n\nIt's not possible to review that number of resumes either, so their are other processes used to 'filter' candidates.\n\n1.When you applied you probably answered questions like 'are you legally able to work in the coubtry you have applied?' These are called prescreen questions, if we have 3000 applicants.. We could automatically remove close to half of them from contention using some prescreen questions.\n\nWe have about 1500 unique applications left in the pool. That number is still too high, so we need to refine the number further.\n\n2. We can ask candidates to do an aptitude test, or a one way video interview. Just asking the candidates to do that will probably filter out another 40% or more, now we have 800 candidates left and the numbers are starting to look manageable (and that's before we even look at the results of the test or the video interview)\n\n3. Now that we have the candidate pool small enough to reasonably look at all the resumes, we can use the results of the tests to determine an order to review resumes.\n\nWe start to go through and filter out resumes further based on the specific requirements of the job they applied for. \n\n4.The goal is to get down to around 10-15 suitable candidates per open job that we want to speak to. So out of 3000 applications received that week, we want to use means of filtering candidates to get down to maybe 150 if there are 15 jobs open...\n\nThose are the people that get a first interview/meeting with a recruiter, less than half that number again will progress to meet a hiring manager.", "timestamp": "2022-10-13T07:27:26Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Do large tech companies use ATS, or some other system to filter resumes?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/y2md65/do_large_tech_companies_use_ats_or_some_other/"}}
