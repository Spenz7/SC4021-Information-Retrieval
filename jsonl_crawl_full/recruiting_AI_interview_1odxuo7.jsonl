{"id": "nl4403b", "text": "Most companies use AI recruiters mainly to save costs and handle volume, not because it makes the hiring experience better.\n\nIf you think about it, the interview is usually a candidate’s first real touchpoint with a company  and replacing that with a bot kills the relationship side of recruiting. People apply to connect with humans, not chat with algorithms.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that candidates are now using AI interview tools to cheat or generate perfect answers in real time, so when companies use AI interviewers, it ends up being AI vs. AI. Everyone sounds the same, and no one gets to see the real person behind the screen.\n\nSure, big fortune 500 companies can get away with that because candidates will jump through any number of hoops just to get in. But for smaller companies, that approach pushes great candidates away.\n\nAt the end of the day, hiring is about people.
