They complain about getting applications for roles thst require citizenship or similar but can't out the effort in to writing or imementing integrations with the myriad of worldwide *government* APIs thst will verify IDs, proof of person, residence, and work rights.\n\nThey complain about people not having degrees or similar, but won't implement steps to integrate with universities to provide sigital signatures and certificates that verify a person has received a title, or out pressure on the higher Ed sector to provide this.\n\nThey complain about candidates not having the necessary set skills, yet won't work with industry to implement and accept standard or proctors exams that serve as the screening portion - for example, simply making it mandatory to even apply for a role to have a certain AWS or MCSE or Oracle certificate. And it is *not* an unreasonable ask to require people to have certain or specific AWS certs in this day and age.\n\nHell, you could cut out 90% of spam AI/automated applications by requiring candidates take a selfie of the self eith a QR code of the application form in the background, or entering a code which you can only obtain from physically attending the office you're applying to work from. Hell, et up a phone number you have to call for a challenge code to the application you're filling in, you can danmed well bet it's gonna be more effort for people to write something to game that than just sftust doing it.\n\nMany of these are utterly trivial steps, but instead we have to put up with our applications being subjected to automatically being filtered out because recruiters are too lazy to put actually hard qualifiers and steps in the application process that a human can complete.\n\nAnd the excuses that will come up? \"Whaaaaa, I don't want to travel to an office\" - then it's not for you, they'll still have 20 candidates who will. \"Whaaaaa I dont like being on camera\" tough.
