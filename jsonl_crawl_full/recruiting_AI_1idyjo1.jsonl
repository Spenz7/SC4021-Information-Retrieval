{"id": "ma9iyaf", "text": "The problem with relocation is that it's just usually not ideal. If there's equally qualified people that are in the location of the job, the out of state applicant is going to have to blow all of them away for my company to want to spend the extra money and/or time on an out of state candidate.\n\nTime is a huge factor, too. There's so many human, unknown factors that can complicate a move and delay someone starting, consequently affecting the company. Relocation isn't blatantly advertised because the goal is to not have the best candidate be out of state. It's not a bad thing, but it can lead to potential headaches for the company.\n\nWhen I've talked to out of state candidates, I want to know their PLAN. I prefer it if they are 100% certain that they will be in the new location by a certain date ams already have housing lined up. That is the best way to pitch them to a hiring manager.\n\nIf they don't have a specific date planned yet, I want to know that they are prepared to break leases, put deposits down, whatever they need. I need to know that their family is already on board if they have one. The absolute worst thing is getting to the final stages after coming up with an offer, bonus structure, a relocation package, and the candidate doesn't accept. It's so much work to come up with all of that!\n\nCandidates who are looking to relocate need to be super clear about their comp expectations and how they expect their move to go.
