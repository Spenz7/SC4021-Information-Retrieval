At most, systems will auto-reject candidates who fail the knock-out questions (e.g., those yes/no questions like “are you authorized to work in the U.S.” and “do you have at least X years of experience in the field”), but those are meant to filter out the non-serious applications / people who apply for every job out there so that way we can review the actually relevant ones. Because that’s the thing, recruiters actually do read each and every resume — that’s the biggest reason why it usually takes so long to hear back these days.
