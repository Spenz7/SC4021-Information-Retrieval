{"id": "f8ad1k5", "text": "I’ve used Hiretual’s AI platform and while it sometimes yields good results, the problem I see with the use of AI for sourcing is that you’re always chasing your tail, so to speak. LinkedIn or whatever place the AI is aggregating info from regularly tightens up their security controls and then you’re stuck with a product that’s only mediocre until an update can be pushed through by the developers (if it can be fixed at all). A good, seasoned sourcer can much more quickly adapt to those types of problems, although I do still occasionally use hiretual’s AI if I can’t find contact info anywhere after searching on my own.\n\nFor basic screening of candidates, we’ve used AllyO,  (chatbot) although their functionality is somewhat limited, is does allow you to get through a really large number of candidates. I highly recommend Canvas if you’re ever looking for an AI chat/screening/scheduling function. Jobvite recently acquired the company and I am really impressed with what I’ve seen from Canvas so far.\n\nI’ve not used a software product that incorporates both an AI screening and sourcing function. Our business model is fairly complex though and we’ve just not been able to make most aspects of AI screening work.", "timestamp": "2019-11-22T03:38:54Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "AI Recruitment Software that Source", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/dzom7j/ai_recruitment_software_that_source/"}}
{"id": "f8adhad", "text": "Thanks for this, your details about about sourcing is what I was skeptical about when they were selling it.  They were acting like they have all these databases they use but it felt like he slipped up when he mentioned just LinkedIn/Indeed.  A lot of our seasonal jobs are like $12-15/hr jobs and honestly most our candidates aren't on those pages at all.  I had the feeling that a good recruiter would probably do much better than their AI sourcing.\n\nThanks for the tips on Canvas, we got a demo from Paradox and I was sold on their scheduling/chatbot.  Figured if we focused more on products that could get scheduling done/get our few basic screening questions done we'd be picking a better product and saving a ton more time.  I'll check them out too.\n\nEven if we just got screening/scheduling from our first AI software we'd be doing a lot better.  The sourcing part just doesn't seem like it should be our focus at the time.\n\nThanks again.", "timestamp": "2019-11-22T03:44:26Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "AI Recruitment Software that Source", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/dzom7j/ai_recruitment_software_that_source/"}}
{"id": "f8adybu", "text": "Sure thing! Hiretual’s AI does pull from more places than LinkedIn, but TBH, you run into the same issues anyway.

Let me help you set your expectations just right.   \n\n\n  \n1. Initial screens &amp; basic filters: This is AI's bread and butter. Automating preliminary screenings, gauging applicant intent, understanding work hour preferences, and clarifying compensations can be seamlessly handled by a well-programmed system.  \n\n\n  \n2. AI sourcing: Here's where things get tricky. While AI can scrape databases to find potential fits based on set parameters, gauging the intangibles like genuine interest in seasonal roles or cultural fit is still on the borderline. Some platforms might over-promise on this front. Hence, it's always good to approach with a hint of skepticism and request real-world sourcing success metrics from vendors.  \n\n\n  \n3. AI-driven administrative tasks: “Spot on” is the phrase for it. AI truly shines in areas like scheduling, sending notifications, or even sending out preliminary questionnaires. It’s all about automating the repeatable and time-consuming tasks to free up your bandwidth.  \n\n\n  \nSo, while [AI in recruitment](https://recruitcrm.io/blogs/artificial-intelligence-recruitment/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit+organic+syndication&amp;utm_campaign=011-+HIKQuestions) has made significant strides in recruitment, sourcing remains an art interwoven with science. It might be worthwhile to integrate AI for the tasks they're undeniably good at. But that shouldn’t be an excuse to lose sight of the human touch in critical aspects like sourcing.  \n\n\n  \nRemember, the best AI tools should work as an extension of your recruitment team, not a replacement.   \n\n\n  \nHappy recruiting!", "timestamp": "2023-10-04T10:43:58Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "AI Recruitment Software that Source", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/dzom7j/ai_recruitment_software_that_source/"}}
