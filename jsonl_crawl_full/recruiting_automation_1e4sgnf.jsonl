There are various AI tools, like [Recruit CRM](https://recruitcrm.io/blogs/recruit-crm-case-studies/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit+organic+syndication&amp;utm_campaign=011-Answer) which is actively helping recruiters round the globe.", "timestamp": "2024-07-19T15:02:29Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Anyone else annoyed by forced AI usage in staffing?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1e4sgnf/anyone_else_annoyed_by_forced_ai_usage_in_staffing/"}}
