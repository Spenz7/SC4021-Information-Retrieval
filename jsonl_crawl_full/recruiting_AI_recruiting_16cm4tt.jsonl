{"id": "jzover1", "text": "These are more in-house ATS systems. Hardly any search firm would use these. \n\nATS's used by search firms are (and most if not all have a CRM/Campaign component)\n\n* Loxo -My favorite and IMHO the best hands down\n* Crelete -  A great choice and veru close to Loxo but issues with CS and nickle and dime you for add ons (click to call, SMS, etc)\n* PCRecruiter - An industry standard for decades. Slow to catch up on some stuff\n* Bullhorn\n* BigBiller- Good split system via top echlon (this it Top Echelon's ATS)\n* RecruitCRM\n* Jobin.cloud- New to the game and has some great features. Sign up for the free version and use their x-ray search and there automation to remove old outstanding LI connection requests. \n* Tracker\n* Recuitflow\n* Recruitly- UK based and not bad at all\n* Vincere- heard some good and bad about this ATS. Platform looks great. \n* Manatal- Decent bang for your buck ATS. like $10-15 a month with a lot of features. \n* CEIPAL- IMHO one of the best and a great price point ($150 +/- a month for 5 seats) for Temp/Contract recruiting firms\n\nI am sure I missed a bunch but these are ones I have used or demoed in my 20+ career. \n\nAll these have a Chrome extension to parse LI., monster, indeed, etc... profiles into your ATS.", "timestamp": "2023-09-08T16:09:57Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "What an ATS System Really Does", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/16cm4tt/what_an_ats_system_really_does/"}}
