{"id": "nyk5w8h", "text": "You’re not wrong , his answers don’t line up with 7 years of desktop support. Not knowing the OS you support, mixing up ticketing systems, and needing to look up basic context is a pretty big mismatch for that title. Now,that said, I’ve started seeing two different patterns that can produce this exact vibe:\n\n\\-Resume/title inflation (straight up). People stack buzzwords (DoD, compliance, ServiceNow, “OS troubleshooting”) because they know it gets them past filters, but they’ve never actually owned the work day-to-day.\n\n\\-Environment/title mismatch (especially gov/DoD). Some roles are “IT-adjacent” , compliance, access requests, process-heavy support  and the person genuinely thinks they did “OS troubleshooting” because their world was tickets + accounts + policy. So they aren’t lying in their head… they’re just not the profile you’re hiring for.\n\nAnd then there’s the 2025/2026 layer on top: AI coaching. Candidates can rehearse a “credible” pitch and use the right keywords, but when you ask anything concrete (version numbers, tools used daily, how they triage, what their escalation path looks like), they can’t stay anchored. That’s why you got the weird mix of “confident claim” + “I need to look it up.”\n\nIMO the takeaway isn’t “you’re an idiot” , it’s that the fastest way to avoid this is to move the screen from buzzwords → specificity. Like:\n\n“Walk me through the last ticket you worked: what was the issue, what did you try first, what fixed it?”\n\n“What ticketing system did you use daily? What fields did you actually fill out?”\n\n“If a user says ‘my laptop is slow,’ what are your first 3 checks?”\n\n“What Windows versions have you supported recently?” (Even “mostly Win10/11” is fine ,“I think Windows?” is not.)\n\nThose 3–5 questions usually expose whether someone has real reps or just a resume that reads well. Saves you from the 30-minute awkward call and it’s fairer to the candidates who actually know their stuff.", "timestamp": "2026-01-09T07:52:36Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Am I the idiot here?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1q7qfpo/am_i_the_idiot_here/"}}
