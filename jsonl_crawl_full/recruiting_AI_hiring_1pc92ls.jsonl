When summaries, tagging, and next-step logic update themselves, everything downstream becomes 10x easier, especially response tracking and follow-ups.\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed across the firms I’ve worked with is that it’s not just the summaries themselves, but the way they feed into the shortlist that matters. When the system knows how to categorize applicants, score them, and move them into the right stage automatically, you avoid the inbox pileup altogether. Most of the overwhelm comes from the *movement* between stages, not the volume itself.\n\nI haven’t used ParseStream personally, but tools in that category can be solid if they help surface the right people faster without adding cleanup.

{"id": "nw6e8pi", "text": "Ouch, that hit way too hard! \n\nYou're not wrong though, hiring has become chaotic. like, I remember when you could actually vibe with a candidate on a call, not sit there wondering if ChatGPT wrote their entire backstory. only thing that’s helped me lately is building candidate pools before roles open up. its like just staying in touch with solid folks so i dont have to start from scratch each time. also, shorter job posts with real talk instead of corporate fluff seems to scare off the AI auto-appliers a bit. but yeah... hiring used to be chess. now it’s a dodgeball game that recruiters play with blindfolds on hahaha", "timestamp": "2025-12-27T11:45:03Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Remember when hiring was actually fun ?

In a modern employee search, you spend most of your time stuck in lines screening, filtering, validating before you even reach someone who genuinely read the role. The inefficiency is draining.
