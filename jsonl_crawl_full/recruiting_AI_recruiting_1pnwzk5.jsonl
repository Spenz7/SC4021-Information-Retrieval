Ai is a paid business service and it will be to businesses what streaming subscriptions are to households… a foot in the door that turns into a never ending expensive cost cluster. People pay more for streaming than they did for cable.

I have a friend who works for Clone Force that has \"digital teamates\" which could be used as a recruiter. We all now want human interaction still. However; I do believe the future generation will be adapted to AI and that will be the norm. I don't think recruiters will be replaced in the next few years or maybe, as AI will change things fast.  If clinicians want more pay, I can honestly say they will forgo \"human interaction\" and if AI improves with communication and process. Again, I'm in Healthcare. CEO's of staffing want to cut operations and pay, so that they can make more. Hospitals are going to be using robots and virtual nurses (Nexus Bedside) has Aimee.  Those are cost cutting measures for hospitals.  Overall, I think agency recruiters in different verticals could in fact be replaced or the amount of recruiters even needed will drastically be reduced. I think what's more at play is the direction our world is going.

They’re struggling because volume is high, signal is low, and a huge amount of time gets eaten up by admin, coordination, and poorly defined requirements. AI can genuinely help there, things like scheduling, summarizing, consistency checks, and reducing repetitive work.\n\nWhere it tends to break down is when AI is used as a replacement for judgment instead of a support for it. Early-stage filtering, AI interviews, or hard ranking models often optimise for speed and risk reduction, not for identifying potential or fit. That’s usually when good candidates disengage or get screened out for the wrong reasons.\n\nThe teams having the most success seem to use AI to create space for better human decisions, not to remove humans from the process.

{"id": "nvtytip", "text": "Here's the thing nobody wants to say out loud: we're not choosing between traditional and AI recruiting. That ship has sailed. 87% of companies are already using AI, and if you're still debating whether to adopt, you're not being strategic; you're being left in the dust. It's bigger than calendar tools for scheduling appointments or advanced ATS systems. \n\nBut before anyone accuses me of being a tech evangelist, let me be clear: AI isn't the savior, and it's definitely not the enemy. It's a tool. And like any tool, it can build something extraordinary or burn the whole thing down, depending on who's holding it.\n\nHere's what I've learned from years of placing leaders and watching this industry go through all the various evolutions.\n\nTHE GOOD STUFF:  \n• Speed matters. AI can scan millions of profiles in seconds, reducing application review time by 80%. That's not hype; that's math. For recruiters drowning in volume, this is oxygen.  \n• AI figures out what successful people have in common. Predictive analytics can identify which executives are most likely to succeed in specific roles based on historical data. We're moving from gut-feel to informed judgment.  \n• It frees you up to do other stuff. When AI handles the administrative drudgery like resume screening, interview scheduling, and initial outreach, recruiters get to do what they're actually good at: building relationships, reading between the lines, and assessing stuff like judgment and fit.\n\nTHE REAL CONCERNS (and they're not small):  \n• We're optimizing for history. AI learns from past hiring patterns. If those patterns were biased (spoiler: they where), the algorithm automates discrimination at scale. Recent studies show AI tools have discriminated badly in certain cases, so the conversation is shifting to governance and compliance, and programmers are getting sued. John Sumser recently mentioned how can you trust AI when you know that LLMs pick the not perfect word 15% of the time. Of course, that rate will come down over time, but we aren't there yet, and now there are laws (EU, NYC, CA) and more to come, with HR generalists becoming AI generalists.   \n• Deskilling is happening. (I just published a post on this.) When junior staff never learn the fundamentals because AI does it all, we lose the depth of expertise needed for future innovation. Organizations are already merging departments and flattening structures because \"AI can handle it.\" But who develops the next generation of senior talent if nobody builds skills from the ground up?  \n• The \"black box\" problem is real. When you can't explain why the algorithm rated a candidate poorly, you've got a compliance nightmare and a trust problem. And 66% of candidates are already wary of AI making hiring decisions.\n\nSO WHAT'S THE ANSWER?  \nIt's not either/or. It's both/and. What I call the \"Human-Machine Hybrid Model\":  \n• Use AI for what it does best: speed, scale, data analysis, and initial screening.  \n• Use humans for what we do best: context, nuance, stakeholder trust, detecting authenticity (because yes, candidates are now using AI to game your AI-drive ATS).  \n• We MUST be transparent and candid when AI is in the process. Give them retakes on video interviews. Build trust, not hide behind algorithms. I built my own custom chat and interview tools (audio and video), and candidates are so much more relaxed when they know they get redos, because who gets that in an interview? Of course, these are just screening interviews to cover the basics, or, as an executive search consultant, I use the video interview for the finalists as a way to show them to the client in a way that's different from just on paper. They get 7 days to do it at their leisure and can play it back and rerecord if they want.   \n• Don't use a Swiss Army knife if you need something more precise. ChatGPT won't cut it for high-stakes C-suite placements. \n\nThe question stopped being 'Will AI replace recruiting?' It already has, in part. Now the question is: What kind of recruiter will you be? The winners won't be the ones clinging to the old ways or chasing every trend. They'll be the ones asking better questions, building systems that work, and remembering we're placing people, not processing paperwork.", "timestamp": "2025-12-25T05:47:02Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Traditional vs New modern AI recruiting", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1pnwzk5/traditional_vs_new_modern_ai_recruiting/"}}
