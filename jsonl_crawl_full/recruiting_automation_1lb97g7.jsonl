Companies have to have separate business licenses to operate in each state.\n\nThen we review resumes, usually in reverse chronological order (oldest first), and can incredibly quickly DQ people. If you are a barista studying archaeology it takes me milliseconds to DQ you. I can do this on my phone in the middle of the night or while I’m watching Netflix or Monday morning. \n\nWhile doing that quick DQ, I’m also putting people into two other “buckets” - possibles and WOWZA. If you really do quickly appear to match, I pull you out and put you into a “look closer here first”. \n\nMost people are quickly DQ’d, and the remainders are mostly “maybes”.\n\nIf this is one of the scanarios where I am crushed by applicants, I can do a VERY BASIC search for things like - if we are searching for a Java developer, I can search Java, then mark everyone who did NOT have the word Java in their resume as DQ. And I’m simplifying here - recruiters HATE to miss good applicants, so I’m not really just searching Java, I’m searching (Java AND (developer OR programmer OR engineer) AND (Spring OR Spring Boot OR Hibernate OR J2EE OR \"REST API\" OR Microservices) AND (SQL OR MySQL OR Oracle OR MongoDB). Minus barista :). This is assuming the ATS even allows full booleans, if not we’re probably just individually clicking through a slog.\n\nIf you search “Boolean” here, you’ll see we literally have competitions to see who is best at sorting data to find everyone, not miss anyone. We even account for people’s misspellings in their own resumes.\n\nOnce I get a good pool of people to begin talking to, I begin outreach and then stop looking at new applicants until I’ve already processed the first batch. If I have massive amounts of good people already I might turn off the ad if I’m legally allowed to. That is risky though because ads cost money and if you mess up and DON’T have the right  person already you might have to repost and spend thousands. Or your ATS might automatically send rejection notices to everyone if you turn off the ad, and you don’t want to tell anyone no yet.\n\nI begin processing the first batch of good people, half of whom don’t respond, others who lied or are out of salary range or try to talk politics w me on the phone screen.\n\nIf I get a superstar and we make an offer and start right away, I will then DQ everyone else. Doesn’t matter if they are a great fit or just applied - they get the DQ because we made a hire.\n\nUsually it’s much longer and messy and I spend more of my time hunting down hiring managers for feedback on resumes or interviews than any other single task.\n\nThen at the end of the year my friends in HR run compliance reporting and pull the anonymized legally required EEO data (sex and race) from the applications (things average recruiters and hiring managers never see) to show how well we’re attracting a diverse pool of applicants and crunch numbers like how much do we pay the average man or Asian or person over 40 or person who had been with us for five years versus new hire.\n\nThen we read a hundred legal guidance papers on what we must and must not do and develop training on it and discuss (and this was three years ago) how New York passed the first AI legislation so we can’t use it in hiring decisions which we don’t want to do anyway because hiring managers never know what they want and candidates are terrible at framing their experience on their resumes and we’re always playing middle man anyway and we’ll worry about AI replacing us once we stop spending our days playing marriage counselor between companies and candidates.\n\nOh and then we’re bombarded with a 100 sales pitches a week from fly by night engineers who have developed an “all in one AI hiring solution” that we can see within seconds is a useless non compliant illegal disaster that will only be purchased by people who have never recruited a day in their life and won’t work when they try to use it!\n\nETA typos.
