{"id": "lxuhbeg", "text": "I'm confused on the specific challenge you're having. There is no such ATS that screens out resumes based on \"subtle\" issues with their resume. The most I've seen an ATS do in terms of screening is provide a match % and/or ranking system based on keyword matches. \n\nAlso, why do you need a system to scrutinize resumes for retail? That's high volume churn and burn recruiting. If you're having a lot of candidates come through and need to screen the resumes better for the recruiting team, try to add application questions that you can knock people out on like availability to work weekends &amp; holidays, pay rates, etc. \n\nThe next best thing you can do is ensure you're minimizing the steps to interview and select. Find a system that automates workflows well and can allow your hiring managers to be more hands on with scheduling interviews themselves. \n\nLastly, find something that (1) keeps and reports on good data and (2) has great customer support.", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T00:18:59Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "ATS Recommendations", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1gtt1vx/ats_recommendations/"}}
