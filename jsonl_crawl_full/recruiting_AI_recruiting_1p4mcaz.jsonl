A lot of tools basically wrap shallow AI search around limited datasets and call it innovation. We built our tool very differently, closely with recruiters, with highly structured search. So I’d honestly love your take on whether that’s a direction that feels more helpful or still misses the mark.\n\nRe outreach, I also agree it gets bad when people blast messages to low-signal candidates they clearly shouldn’t reach out to. But if someone is actively looking for work, and you have a role that’s actually relevant to their background, I’ve always felt that’s not spam, that's positive outreach that's helpful. Curious if you see that differently?\n\nAlso, daily.dev is an interesting mention.\nWhat do you feel they’re doing right for the tech hiring space?\nWe’re working toward something similar longterm, a community and real support for job seekers, but we believe you have to fix the company side before you can meaningfully improve the demand side (especially for the hiring experience).\n\nGenuinely would love your insight here.
