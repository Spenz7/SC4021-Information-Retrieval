Too many candidates start out tailoring their resumes, but when they check all of the boxes and don't hear back from tons of jobs, it just doesn't feel worth the effort, especially with the absolute insanity of needing to compete nationally for positions.\n\nCandidates really need to keep updating their resumes, but if companies want qualified candidates to put in that effort, they need to make their requirements clearer and make it less of a hassle to apply. This starts with using standardized job titles, making it crystal clear what is a required qualification and what is suggested, killing off required cover letters (no one reads them since it's just the resume rewritten into an essay in most cases), only posting the job when they're actually planning to hire externally, closing the job posting if they have several candidates close to final stages, only asking for info that they actually use to decide if the candidate will be asked for an interview, actually staff hiring teams properly, reduce the rounds of interviews for positions where possible, etc.\n\nThat's not in the control of most recruiters, but it's going to require people on all sides of the process to work together to fix this mess...

It takes really understanding what the hiring manager needs - beyond just \"thinking outside the box\" or whatever buzzwords they list.

{"id": "l8fbjiq", "text": "I mostly do headhunting for niche work but when we have a job that we have to throw the net out for the process for **1 fully remote job** goes like this:  \nPost the job, receive 2000-4000 candidates, only \\~700 are even remotely qualified, but now I have to sift through them in varying ways (you didn't answer a yes/no basic hiring question? Get bent you aren't being considered).   \nContact around 400 people, only get responses from 200, request more info and only get 50-60 responses, schedule first round phone interviews, get ghosted by at least half, only left with 3-7 genuinely qualified candidates in my pipeline. Which sounds great BUT...  \nLeadership drags their asses (\"can the candidate wait 3-6 weeks for an interview???\") or ask stupid (at times offensive despite being told not to ask those) questions in interviews, candidates take other jobs or decide its not for them. Left with 3ish candidates, leadership thinks we can find a unicorn so whY hIRe NoOOw??? (kill me)  \n  \nFuck it I'll headhunt, we don't pay as much as tech/big corps, nobody is interested.

{"id": "l8fbnbj", "text": "I once applied to a life changing job.  Over a year went by and I moved on took another job in the meantime.  One year and 3 months later a recruiter called me up asking if I was available for the school the position required (an unpaid climbing school for lineman that was several hours away). If I had received proper notice I would’ve still had vacation time saved up but since these jabronis literally never called me back I had long since moved on and didn’t have the vacation time to cover the school especially with only 2 weeks notice that the school was approaching.  \n\nHow is this possible and why is this so common with recruiters?  How hard is it to stay in touch with a candidate you want to hire?  I literally laughed at this dude when he asked why I wouldn’t be able to make it.  I told him the short answer was because he sucked at his job and hung up.", "timestamp": "2024-06-13T13:50:25Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Recruiters, what is a surprising fact that most people outside the profession are unaware of?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1dcvgoq/recruiters_what_is_a_surprising_fact_that_most/"}}

People act like generative AI is capable of it and the booms there mean booms everywhere but in reality most AI is behind. But what generative AI has done is open the doors.
