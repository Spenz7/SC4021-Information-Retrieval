As in, their code didn’t correctly fill in my name and left the field with its generic placeholder.\n\n2) You aren’t the only employer doing it, and the messages all look very samey. When I receive a random message from a recruiter who has no prior connection to me but wants to give the impression they’ve just accidentally stumbled across my profile and thought I was a great fit, I find myself cringing. \n\n3) I’ve also previously had automated recruiter messages for roles that don’t tie in with my specific field of work, or don’t align with my work experience. One of them said something like they didn’t know if I was familiar with X software but experience of any similar software in Y field would be handy. Profile clearly states I’ve been using X software for 5 years. \n\nIt’s not that AI and bots don’t make mistakes, it’s that - at least in my experience - the mistakes they DO make render them the equivalent of an incompetent human.", "timestamp": "2025-11-17T02:45:01Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Anyone else notice candidates can instantly tell when you're using AI for outreach?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1ovw8cv/anyone_else_notice_candidates_can_instantly_tell/"}}
