It is highly likely that my company’s reputation would suffer if we were to start treating candidates like faceless commodities.  \n\nMy questions:  \n\nWhich ATS do you use?

{"id": "l3mn35q", "text": "Hello forum, long time listener first time caller :) \n\nSpicy take incoming, so buckle up Lol\n\n  \nI've read replies here and my head is about to explode from how arrogant some folks in recruiting profession really are!\n\nYES, candidate experience matters a lot, but who told you that a mandatory phone call with YOU is what makes this experience better? \n\nSomebody brought up the engineers POV - great idea, lets follow it to the end though:   \nImagine you are an engineer who is proactively looking for a job. You have a list of 10 companies you want to interview at, you are on blind and on [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) - so you know about each company, or even about a specific team more than the recruiter will ever be able to tell you, you often even know what LeetCode questions they ask on technical screens and on in-house. Now you need to apply and get to the rounds that really count. Do you think this engineer is excited to spend 30 minutes of their time per call talking to 10 of you answering the same questions over and over again :D ? Have you asked them how they feel about it? I have - and what I've heard is: \"Yeah it's not great, but its part of the process, so I do it.\"\n\nSo lets get over ourselves folks, engineers are not excited to talk to us. It is far more important to them to get our attention and a certain response within a reasonable timeframe so that they could manage their interview timeline.\n\nA few folks brought up a point that a \"skilled recruiter\" should not have a problem sorting through hundreds of resumes and finding relevant candidates, and to those I have one thing to say: don't confuse a hunch with a skill. \n\nLets be honest here: when you have a pile of 100+ resumes you will likely parse them, run through some filters based on yoe, past companies, tech stack, etc, and then manually scan diagonally those that make it through the filter. That is until you get tired and say to yourself: \"okay, this is good enough for the first batch\" and give up. This is my process, and I don't think that I am applying any \"skill\" here. And I am willing to bet, this is everyone else's process too, because what else can you do? I know some agencies outsource this part, but I am in-house so I can't.\n\nNow lets get to the meat of the matter: the actual conversation with engineer. I hope noone here believes that they can reliably differentiate a great engineer a from good one. You need to be an an engineer yourself to do that, and even those guys get it wrong sometimes. We can only sort out those that kinda \"sound legit\" and filter out based on some behavioral red flags. \n\n  \nSo I agree with OP that the process is inefficient, and it is reasonable to try to use software and AI to make it better. I personally don't know enough about AI to tell what is or isn't possible, so I'll probably wait until something gains enough traction before taking a risk on it. Concerns about security and compliance are also real, so kudos to folks who brought those up, this would be important for me as well.", "timestamp": "2024-05-11T21:37:57Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Automating Initial Screening Calls for Software Developers?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1cpge8d/automating_initial_screening_calls_for_software/"}}
