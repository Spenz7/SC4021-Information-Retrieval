I’d recommend trying Recooty or TFY, and between the two, I’d suggest Recooty because the functionalities they offer at their price point are just too good to be true!\n\nAI candidate matching and the integration of their dashboard with 250+ job boards give your job posting a huge reach and expansion, so try using that.", "timestamp": "2025-09-10T09:46:29Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "AI Sourcing -  Have you found that magic tool?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1k4huyg/ai_sourcing_have_you_found_that_magic_tool/"}}
{"id": "nj3zff9", "text": "The harsh reality is that the \"magic bullet\" AI sourcing tool doesn't exist yet, and honestly might never exist in the way we want it to.\n\nHere's what I've learned after testing pretty much every AI sourcing platform out there: they're all solving different pieces of the puzzle, but none are nailing the complete workflow. The accuracy issue you're hitting is real because most of these tools are still fundamentally limited by the data they can access and how well they understand nuanced job requirements. LinkedIn's API restrictions, outdated contact info, and the fact that the best candidates often aren't actively broadcasting their availability means even the smartest AI is working with incomplete information. What I've found works better is accepting that you'll need 2-3 tools max, but being really strategic about which ones complement each other. Instead of chasing the perfect all-in-one solution, focus on tools that integrate well and cover different strengths like one for contact finding, another for boolean search optimization, maybe a third for engagement sequencing. The time you're spending jumping between tools usually gets offset by better quality results when each tool is doing what it actually does well. The real efficiency gains come from streamlining your process around these tools rather than expecting one tool to do everything perfectly.", "timestamp": "2025-10-12T14:50:35Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "AI Sourcing -  Have you found that magic tool?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1k4huyg/ai_sourcing_have_you_found_that_magic_tool/"}}
