But I always use canned whole Bianco Dinapoli tomatoes. If you just crush/blend those up and add salt until it tastes good, you're more than golden. The best pizza sauce is SIMPLE SIMPLE SIMPLE.\n\nFor cheese, try and find full fat low moisture mozz. Bizarrely, *Walmart* of all places has a store brand string cheese that's full fat rather than low fat, you can just slice it into little medallions and throw it on.
