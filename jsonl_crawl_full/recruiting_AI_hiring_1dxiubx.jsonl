{"id": "lc3aiow", "text": "I'll go ahead and further explain the timing of applying for those who don't believe it matters. Most large companies in the US need to abide by OFCCP regulations. The TLDR of that is that recruiters can't just cherry pick who they want to interview from the applicant inbox. They must, first, determine who meets minimal qualifications and then they can stack rank who they want to talk to.\n\nIf the min quals are very stringent, timing won't have that much of an impact. However, if the min quals are fairly wide open and the applicant flow is strong, companies will have created ways to manage that applicant flow while still being compliant.\n\nOne way is to unpost the req as early as possible. Now there's probably a minimum posting time, but if the req is resulting in a firehose, the recruiter will I post as soon as they can. The second will be some data management technique. In every company I've ever worked (that was OFCCP), we reviewed applicants in blocks, traunches, cohorts, however you want to put it.!if we found what we needed in those early blocks, we ignored the rest and ultimately rejected them.
