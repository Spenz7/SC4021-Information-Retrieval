{"id": "naioglf", "text": "I would say make sure you REALLY love this space before jumping in. Transparently, now's a pretty crappy time to try to break into recruiting and I would personally wait to do it. But to answer your questions:   \n  \n1) In terms of the job market for recruiting, it depends on a LOT of factors. In-house recruiting I would say is the most elusive - thousands of applicants for every job opening, not a lot of investment right now into permanent in house positions due to slower growth, and you'll be in competition with recruiters with years of experience. Depending on where you're located (Silicon Valley, NYC, etc.) you might have better luck with tech startups given the AI boom, but it'll still be super competitive. I would look for Coordinator/Entry-Level Sourcing positions. Potentially even Entry-Level HR Generalist/Talent Acquisition Generalist positions where you're doing a little of everything and the business acumen can help you stick out. \n\n2) I haven't been in the agency space for a bit, but lately I've noticed companies are leaning more into contract hiring and outsourcing to agencies so you might have better luck there within Technical Recruiting. But agency is a very churn and burn vibe: very sales, very high volume, usually very stressful unless you get a high off of that climate. If you think you can hack it, it's easier to break into agency.   \n  \n3) I'd say the pros are, if you join a really great company, you feel like a partner rather than an order taker. You can change someone's life (e.g. I've had candidates cry on the phone bc I offered them a job with a life changing amount of money). If you're a people person/a talker/love communicating, it's a great job where you're basically relationship building and doing customer service/consulting all day. \n\n4) Cons? It's an under appreciated role in a saturated market. Lots of recruiters are burned out, scared for their jobs, unemployed, can't find work, and feeling the looming pressure of the future of AI. Maybe that'll change in the future if the economy heals, but we have no crystal balls. It'll likely take a minute.", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T02:26:55Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "PM considering transition to Recruiting thoughts?!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1mzee5x/pm_considering_transition_to_recruiting_thoughts/"}}

{"id": "naioadi", "text": "It feels so odd to me that anyone and everyone thinks they can just casually pivot into recruiting. It’s an awful time trying to pivot into recruiting, let alone in the tech space. And I say this as a recruiter in tech, who has hired PMs, designers, etc. \n\nThere are so many unemployed recruiters, including those coming from tech backgrounds. This is going to sound harsh, but you’re up against people who actually have proven, battle tested experience under their belt. Why would they take a risk on you, with no recruiting experience, in the most highly desired/highly paid recruiting space (tech), and hope that you pan out and actually like the career field after 6 months - when they get 4k apps in a week for a recruiter role?\n\nBe ready to take a pay cut, and your best bet is to join an agency.
