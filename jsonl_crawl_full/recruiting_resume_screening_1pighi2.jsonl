I did recognize that those were an attempt cull the spam, bot, or bullshitter applicants from the legitimate ones, and so I would bookmark those pages or pin the emails, but I actually never went back and did them because I decided to use that time completing additional applications instead. \n\nSomething I noticed (off the top of my head, FedEx was one that used this) that some companies had integrated a chatbot into the process as step 1. Like I couldn’t even get the link to apply until I had gone back and forth with the bot and answered its questions. “What’s your first name?” “Last?” “Best contact number?” “Email?” Upload resume, and then it invited me to apply and provided the link/sent it to my email and phone too. \n\nIt felt annoying at the time, but I did it, so it wasn’t annoying enough for me to abandon the process, because I only put forth this (marginal, but still) extra effort for jobs that I was legitimately very interested in. For jobs that were meh, I abandoned it at the point of chatbot pop up. Now thinking about it in the context of this post, this feels like it might be a good middle ground solution, because don’t you **want** to filter for the people that are genuinely interested enough in the role to find it worth spending a few extra minutes with the bot? \n\nThe resume sprayers (who I imagine are often the same ones that are wildly exaggerating or totally fabricating their resumes anyway) aren’t gonna do that, and if it’s an automated applying bot service, the chatbot aspect may even trip it up enough to have it abandon the attempt (for now anyway, as soon as these ATS integrated chatbots become popular enough, the auto-apply spammer apps will be coded to interact with them, I’m sure).   \n\nAnyway, just my 2 cents as a recent job seeker who has also been a hiring manager.", "timestamp": "2025-12-09T20:57:54Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Candidate impersonation at an all-time high - tips?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1pighi2/candidate_impersonation_at_an_alltime_high_tips/"}}

{"id": "ntio1eq", "text": "A few things recruiters we speak with say are helping a bit at the resume stage: they’re doing very simple consistency checks between the CV and LinkedIn (name, email, work history), and if the LinkedIn URL is real but the contact details clearly don’t match, they just don’t move that person forward. Some have also added one small “friction” step that requires original input, like a short role-specific question candidates answer in their own words. It’s not perfect, but a lot of the impersonators either drop off there or paste something so obviously generic it’s easy to spot.\n\nThe other thing that seems to reduce the time drain is being very transparent upfront that there will be an identity verification step and, in some cases, onsite or in-person onboarding.

{"id": "nt6e0su", "text": "I understand your point, but I think we are looking at this from very different angles. What you describe as “not doing a pre assessment” is, in practice, still a form of pre screening. Asking about relocation, years of experience, previous tasks, residency, education and even requiring a cover letter are all additional steps candidates must complete before a real interview. They simply happen inside the application form instead of in a separate workflow.\n\nThe challenge is that these steps are often the least efficient ones. They create a lot of repetitive manual work for recruiters and do very little to surface genuine fit. Reading through dozens of nearly identical cover letters or application paragraphs is not a meaningful evaluation. It is just time consumption disguised as process.\n\nThe industry is changing fast, and the people who adapt usually gain a significant advantage in speed and clarity. A short, structured pre step can actually respect both sides: candidates know exactly what matters, and recruiters spend less time sorting through noise. Holding on to older manual methods sometimes feels familiar, but familiar does not always mean effective.\n\nWhat I am building with CornJobs is not a long test or a barrier. It is a simple Telegram conversation link that replaces repetitive screening with a clear, consistent set of role focused questions. Candidates answer in a few minutes, and you get something far more meaningful than a copied cover letter.\n\nSome recruiters prefer the comfort of doing everything manually, and there is nothing wrong with that. But efficiency often comes from embracing tools that remove tasks that do not actually require human judgment. In my experience, the smartest workflows are the ones that keep humans where they matter and automate the parts that only slow everyone down.", "timestamp": "2025-12-09T21:02:15Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Candidate impersonation at an all-time high - tips?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1pighi2/candidate_impersonation_at_an_alltime_high_tips/"}}

{"id": "ntd9dno", "text": "Here's my 2 cents:\n\n1. Never hire someone who does not have a LinkedIn profile picture. Scammers tend to have a LinkedIn with no profile picture so HR cannot cross verify the ID with the LinkedIn picture.\n2. Have a video call with HR + HM and ask the candidate to show ID. Scams originating from India, Pakistan, and Mexico use other people's SSN and ID to score jobs with fake resumes.\n3. Require at least one reference from the most recent employer who is still at the company. Fake references are done in 2 ways: Either by saying the manager is no longer at that company and has a new email or by listing small shelf companies.\n4. First recruiter call should have specific case based questions with right answers indicated to the recruiter already. Usually these profiles are run by a team of Diallers and not the tech resource. First call is where you can capture such people.\n5. Never trust someone with a google phone number. If someone uses google phone as their primary phone number, it is already fishy.\n6. Use a video submission system that captures origin IP as well during submission (Not just the surfing IP which can be spoofed with VPN). This filters out people who are out of states and are defrauding people out of US remote roles.\n7. No camera, No call, No hire. Make everything camera-mandatory and these fraudsters will run.\n8. Ask for some photo identity before HM interview and get that ID to HM so they can be sure they are on a video call with the person whose credentials are being shared.\n9.
