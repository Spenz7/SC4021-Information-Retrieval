The stack’s definitely getting more modular with AI in the mix.\n\nHere’s what we’ve been experimenting with or hearing good things about:\n\n• **Ashby** – still one of the cleanest all-in-one ATS options, especially if you care about reporting  \n• **Hireflow or Gem** – for outbound sourcing and sequencing  \n• **Metaview** – agree with you here, real-time note-taking and summaries are a game-changer  \n• **Fetcher** – for automated sourcing + outreach if you want something lightweight\n\nThe common theme we're seeing at Truffle from talking to customers is that small tools solving very specific problems really well.

The integration landscape is getting interesting but also more complex.\n\nWe're actually tackling some of these workflow challenges at [Promap](https://www.promap.ai) \\- there's definitely a gap between what most ATS systems offer and what SMBs/startups actually need for their hiring processes. A lot of the \"AI screening\" features are still pretty basic tbh.\n\nOne thing I'm noticing is that the best results come from combining a solid foundation (good ATS) with purpose-built AI tools rather than trying to find one system that does everything. Like your Metaview integration - thats exactly the kind of targeted solution that actually moves the needle.\n\nCurious what specifically made Metaview so impactful for your workflow?
