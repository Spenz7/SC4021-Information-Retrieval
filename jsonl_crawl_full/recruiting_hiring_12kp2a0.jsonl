{"id": "jg86vos", "text": "So, I am a weird person as I understand both positions.\n\n1) salary transparency makes sense for 90%+ of jobs. It not only prevents wasting time, but also brings equity to historically discriminated groups.\n\n2) it is different for those positions that have power. For example, high level executive positions. At these levels there is an ability and willingness to get creative on compensation, and people aren’t in the same level of vulnerability.\n\nThe problem is when companies have historically discriminated against groups, and been predatory, you have to regulate globally.\n\nThat said, I think pay transparency has pushed companies to be better. For the company I recently left, it forced more active compensation reviews. Instead of once a year “right sizing” comp, every job post forced us to look at market rates and, often, provide internal raises. We embraced this with surprise “you should be paid more!”, events and, not surprising, our retention, productivity and profit grew far more than the costs.\n\nOn the time wasting side, I have been at 4th round interviews where we had not discussed comp and they sent an offer they thought was strong, only to find out they were no where near the same ballpark as I was playing.

{"id": "jjq8mb5", "text": "Idiots. So they would rather vex and frustrate candidates by not finding out that salary expectations are aligned until far into the process and hoping that sunk cost fallacy will see them through. What arseholes. If I came across this only to discover further along that the salary is crap, I'd be fucking cross and not likely to consider the company in the future. It's like the switch-and-bait of remote work and then turns out to be a crappy, fixed hybrid. And also not to \"upset\" existing staff? How fucking delusional, so they are hoping and praying that their existing staff don't find out how much they are underpaid.
