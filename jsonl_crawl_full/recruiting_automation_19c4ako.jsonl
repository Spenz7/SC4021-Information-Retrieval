Before you jump into taking that excel course, ask yourself this:\n\n1) Where is the data coming from, and how often is it collected? If it’s coming from an HRIS or ATS system, is it automated? Does it have scheduled reporting? What data does it contain? \n\n2) How “clean” or accurate is the data? Does it depend on users to fill fields on their employment profile? Are managers also filling out data? Does it contain all the fields that are deemed useful? Any privacy concerns? \n\nMost of the time I’ve seen companies fail at this step because they don’t have the data “maturity” to have the infrastructure to collect accurate data. \n\nOnce you have access to raw data and have a predictable understanding of where it’s from and how accurate it is, you’re going to need to turn that into insights. It needs to answer questions that your managers can use. If your managers aren’t getting value from your business intelligence.

{"id": "l7arir4", "text": "I work at one of the top TI firms and I can tell you that they want people with industry - HR, TA, TM, etc experience. I would say look into customer success or product marketing roles. They will both be a big leap from the work you’re doing now (lots to learn) but if you get the skills down for such areas, you’ll be a great value add. \n\nIn order to do that, I would start rea ch ing out to people on LinkedIn in those areas and ask them about their jobs and how they got there. What they like and don’t like. And what advice they have for you. \n\nGood luck!

{"id": "kiy5i1n", "text": "This is called HR analytics. Already a thing for $50 dollar intro on coursera. It's a lot more work than you think, but the course is a good intro to understand the task you're undertaking. \n\nThe reason it's hard to find many examples is because each HR dashboard/ analytics tool (whether in excel or in your HRIS) is particular to your company/ industry/ data being tracked. \n\nUnlike what many are saying here,  there is value in understanding the datum, how it's tracked,  and make actionable changes in your org based on that.\n\nYes,  AI can compile the data,  but if you're gathering everyone's first born kids name,  instead of turnover cost,  the AI output will invariably be incorrect. So data integrity and manipulation ARE important because it's nice not to be blind to the output of the machine if the data set is off..\n\nThis is currently the struggle I'm working on actually. Was thinking about building a Chabot for my HR dashboard but going thru and cleaning up data to conform with AAP, and it takes time.... but for some reason I feel like ADP can do 75% of this if my data is clean", "timestamp": "2024-01-21T21:49:47Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "A recruiter planning to pivot into Talent intelligence!!

{"id": "l5fz4dm", "text": "Would love to see how the OP got on with this?\nI’ve been researching it and TI sounds like it’s booming. I disagree with people saying it’s niche and therefore you should stay away….niche is how you specialise and earn more money. It’s also not HR analytics.\nIt is however technical but there’s a whole new industry being developed for it that leverages AI and encompasses more than TA. If I were you I’d try and build a credible case for investing in TI products at your company and stick your hand up to lead a programme rather than become an analyst yourself. Leading these HR Tech programmes is massive for your career and is probably easier for your skill set.\nRead the Josh Bersin stuff he’s brining out on TI - he’s frothing about it and it’s all AI related. If you need help building a case for change feel free to DM me - I know Josh B and he could advise you but do your research first.", "timestamp": "2024-05-24T08:20:45Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "A recruiter planning to pivot into Talent intelligence!!
