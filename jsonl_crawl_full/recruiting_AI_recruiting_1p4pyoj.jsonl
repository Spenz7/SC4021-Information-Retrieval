{"id": "nrhzqvi", "text": "Recruiter here - yes, it is very easy for me to tell when someone has used AI especially if they keep the same formatting that ChatGPT gives you when you download your input into a Word document. The margins are fat, the titles of the different sections are in a light blue color, and under the summary statement, it always has a section called \"Core Competencies.\"  In that Core Compentencies section, the list is always bulleted and in one single column vs taking a skills section and putting it in 2 or 3 columns.  Spacing is usually double-spaced.  Edit to add: also, the ChatGPT version always puts the dates of employment after the vertical bar next to the job title or company, I can' remember which without going to open my work laptop - another giveaway. Again, very easy to see.\n\nWhen I see the dead give away AI resumes, I still read them because I don't mind that someone has gotten help in crafting their resume. I have to assume (or it would drive you nuts) that what people are sending me is the truth of what they can do.  Would it be better if they changed the output stylistically - yes, absolutely.  I do have to say when I open the AI resume, my first thought is, Ok, it's AI, but that's most of it. How good would the resume be if you had all the nicely crafted content in a different format?
