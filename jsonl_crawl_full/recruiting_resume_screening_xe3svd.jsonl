{"id": "ioh9cws", "text": "EDIT: this is from the lenses of a game developer and product manager recruiter. There might be fringe cases where some of the below doesn’t apply that I might not know of because of my hyper specialization for my entire career. \n\nNo to all except maybe the last one but idk why you would put references like that right off the bat. So many problems with using these templates when most professionals don’t need to. Unless you are in a creative function like marketing/design/branding, it literally does nothing to enhance your candidacy and chances of getting the job. The resume needs to have enough room to clearly lay out your accomplishments and achievements at a role (not basic duties required of the role) with clear metrics that showcase those achievements. Wasting a bunch of space on a pretty header with your name and signature blown up means less room for you to brag about all the great things you accomplished at your previous roles. There are ways to personalize your resume and add your unique flair without taking away from the **core function** of a resume. \n\nAs recruiters we are looking for specific achievements and KPIs that you were responsible for handling and the more information you give us about those the easier we are able to make connections to what the team needs and even advocate for you if you had an experience that might not exaclty line up with the need but has **transferable knowledge and skills** that we can leverage to **help you get in front of the hiring manager**. Please help us help you, most of us will advocate for our candidates if you give us the ammunition we need. \n\nLastly, and this is a personal gripe, but listing core competencies as a separate section is a waste of space and can be specifically called out in your bullets stating what the competency is and how you applied it to reach the achievement or specific KPI. \n\nI will never specifically reject a candidate because their resume was formatted weird but I will reject a candidate if their resume isn’t communicating their skills and achievements.", "timestamp": "2022-09-15T02:14:55Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Recruiters, at what point does a resume go from “eye-catching” to “eyesore” (also sorry for taking a phone picture of a computer screen)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/xe3svd/recruiters_at_what_point_does_a_resume_go_from/"}}
