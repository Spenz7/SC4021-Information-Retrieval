It’s an ATS that combines user-friendly features with the CRM functions that many recruitment agencies need. Here’s how VIVAHR could be a solid choice:\n\n* **Data Security &amp; Syncing**: VIVAHR is reliable when it comes to keeping your data, including emails, safe and synced. You won’t be dealing with missing emails or disorganized candidate info, which is a common frustration with other platforms.\n* **Pipeline Management**: The pipeline management in VIVAHR is intuitive and easy to customize, so you can quickly adapt it to fit your recruitment process without feeling bogged down by clunky navigation.\n* **Automation &amp; Job Board Integration**: VIVAHR has strong automation features for repetitive tasks and integrates seamlessly with job boards, allowing for multiposting and even website integration.\n* **Email Templates &amp; Search Functionality**: Its email templates are straightforward and visually polished, eliminating the need to fiddle with clunky HTML. Plus, the search function is efficient, so you can quickly find candidates and contacts with ease.\n\nWhile Bullhorn and Vincere are also robust options, VIVAHR is particularly ideal for small to mid-sized agencies seeking a balance of functionality, automation, and affordability without sacrificing quality.

{"id": "gxp9ok0", "text": "Very insightful thread. My requirements are pretty similar to listed here. I have demo-ed multiple platforms but it's been very challenging to find the right solution. \n\nGood feedback re: Zoho - Looks clunky, poor support and might be overloaded with inefficient/non working features. Def lacks automated omni channel outreach etc. Affordable pricing. \n\nHubspot - Good alternative if you are looking to build inbound marketing/sales channels. Downside is lack of some core Recruitment ATS/CRM functionalities. Could be used to cold outreach over emails but inability to seemlessly link it with outreach campaigns on Linkedin might be a bummer. Also, no careers website or push to other job boards. You might be able to build some good flows linking with 3rd party platforms using their marketplace apps and Integromate/Zapier. I also like the idea of using Hubspot Service as a ticketing platform to deliver exceptional support to Candidates. Definitely not a good option for early stage and lean teams.\n\nRecruitCRM: Neat interface with good basic functionalities. But if you are looking for an end to end simplified yet automation driven machine, lacks a ton of good features you ll prolly find in loxo (eg. Email or omni channel drip campaigns or automated outreach). Also, limited zapier integrations. Found the support and pricing to be pretty solid. Also, very limited LinkedIn integration - can't record LinkedIn conversations as an activity in CRM. \n\nLoxo: Looks like a potential strong fit for my use case. The only 2 negatives: it's expensive and has zero 'openness' to integrate with other 3rd party platforms through zapier or integromat. Has a basic integration with Hubspot - to be explored.", "timestamp": "2021-05-11T06:31:44Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Choosing new ATS&amp; CRM Software", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/mpb7pw/choosing_new_ats_crm_software/"}}

{"id": "jyjfogg", "text": "Won’t lie - reading about your struggle with Zoho Recruit felt like déjà vu. It's a road many of us have been down, and it's indeed time for a change. Have you considered the ATS + CRM by Recruit CRM, though?  \nEmails not syncing? [Recruit CRM](https://recruitcrm.io/features/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit+organic+syndication&amp;utm_campaign=011-+answer) ensures everything's safe and right where you need it. No more lost emails.  \nThe pipeline management? It's simple and intuitive. Organize your workflow without the add-on hassle you DID NOT sign up for.  \nAutomation, job board integration, and multiposting? The ATS has it all. Further, Recruit CRM also has a Talent Pool feature that collects candidates directly from your website - truly a hiring savior.  \nThe search function is robust, and the email templates are sleek and customizable. With them, you put an end to dealing with mediocre HTML codes.  \nSo, I know you've considered Bullhorn and Vincere, but Recruit CRM might just be the ultimate missing link between you and a seamless recruitment drive. Give it a try, and see :)  \nIf you have any more questions or need further insights, I'm here.   \nI wish you a successful journey in finding the ATS &amp; CRM system that fits like a glove.
