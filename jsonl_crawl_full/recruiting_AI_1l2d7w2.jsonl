{"id": "mvtgs0z", "text": "Hey! Great timing on this question - I'm actually working on something related to this space with Promap right now, AI-native sourcing/outreach campaigns, &amp; screening.\n\nFor early stage recruiting at a startup your size, here's what I'd focus on:\n\nCore ATS first - Greenhouse or Lever are solid choices. Don't overcomplicate this part but you need something that actually works vs the skeleton system you mentioned.\n\nAI-powered sourcing - HireEZ and SeekOut are pretty good for automated candidate discovery. They'll save you tons of manual sourcing time which sounds like exactly what you need.\n\nScreening automation - HireVue (never used, but heard good things) can handle initial screening rounds. I hear the AI components have gotten way better recently and can cut your screening time significantly\n\nInterview scheduling - Calendly integration or something like Goodtime.io. Sounds basic but removes so much back-and-forth\n\nThe key thing I learned building products for SMBs is to implement one tool at a time and actually measure the impact before adding more. It's tempting to try to solve everything at once but you'll just create new chaos.\n\nWhat's your current biggest time sink? Like where are you spending most of your hours that feels inefficient? That should probably drive which tool you implement first.\n\nAlso curious what type of roles you're hiring for - technical vs non-technical makes a difference in tooling recommendations.", "timestamp": "2025-06-03T18:44:51Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Recruiting Softwares Advice", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1l2d7w2/recruiting_softwares_advice/"}}
