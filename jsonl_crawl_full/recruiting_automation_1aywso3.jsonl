Let's use software engineering as an example.  \n\n\nIf the candidate applied and you're talking to them on the phone, it means you already accepted their resume. The call is more for you to give more details about the company, go over general HR stuff, and get a vibe check. This call is really just a formality since the candidate already expressed interest in working there and you already accepted their application. You won't be able to tell if the candidate is BSing you; that's for the technical rounds to determine.  \n\n\nIf you reached out to the candidate first and now you're on the phone with them, it means they accepted your initial message. Again, this means they read your message, looked over the role/company, and were interested enough to respond. Again, nothing you say on the phone will change anything (unless you or the candidate decides to shit the bed) and you'll most likely move them to the technical rounds.  \n\n\nIn both of these scenarios, the initial phone screen is more of a formality, yet takes up a huge portion of time. It's much more efficient to automate this with AI.

{"id": "ks2i8za", "text": "Might get this taken down again but, senior level candidate here: I wrote a really cool course using my human data input ethos and a stacked ML/AI prompt series to make a mini course about JUST this.  \n\nThe case study delves into the evolving landscape of job hunting and recruitment, emphasizing the significant challenges both job seekers and employers face in the current market. It highlights the extensive and often disheartening process of job applications, which can involve multiple rounds of interviews and the necessity to navigate through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) by hitting the right keywords and aligning one's summary with the role and culture. The study critiques the traditional approach to hiring, which often seeks conformity over creativity, thereby stifacing innovation and progress within organizations.\n\nProposing a revolutionary solution, the case study advocates for the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in the recruitment process. By leveraging these technologies, the study suggests the creation of a \"report card\" system for both employers and candidates. This system would utilize AI to analyze Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and ATS parameters, providing immediate pass/fail results along with detailed feedback and a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). This approach aims to streamline the hiring process, ensuring a better match between employer needs and candidate capabilities, and reducing the time and ambiguity involved in traditional recruitment methods.\n\nFor HR professionals, recruiters, and talent acquisition specialists, this case study offers a glimpse into the future of hiring, where efficiency, objectivity, and inclusivity are paramount. By adopting AI and ML technologies, they can enhance their recruitment processes, making them more aligned with the dynamic needs of the job market. This not only benefits job seekers by simplifying their application journey but also enables employers to identify and onboard the most suitable candidates swiftly and effectively, thereby fostering innovation and progress within their organizations.\n\nTL/DR:\n\nGood luck OP. We feel it on our end too, it’s a time suck  for either side. We  can use tools at our disposal such as AI/ML to create effective, tailored hiring culture across the board that produce  effective insights and market fit candidates for recruiters.", "timestamp": "2024-02-25T14:23:48Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Initial phone screen is such a waste of time", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1aywso3/initial_phone_screen_is_such_a_waste_of_time/"}}
