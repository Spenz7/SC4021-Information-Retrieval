{"id": "m7mcwge", "text": "What I think a lot of people forget in this conversation is that we are employees as well, and unfortunately, we have to be order takers to a certain extent.\n\nAnecdotally, I’m tasked with about 17 different open roles right now, ranging from finance, to engineering (software, electrical, AND mechanical), to sales, and our business has a hugely supportive TA leadership team that empowers us to push back when we need to about the hiring process (including requirements). \n\nEven with that though, I’ve pushed back and said “hey, I’ve hired for this type of role before and I can tell you upfront that XYZ doesn’t exist at this salary level” or “do we actually need this person to have a degree, or can we sub equivalent experience?” and if the hiring manager says “they need to have this,” …. What am I supposed to do, just refuse to do my job? Of course, I’m not talking about illegal requirements, that’s a totally different story. \n\nUltimately, the hiring manager is the expert on what their team does, and what their team needs. The more specialized we can become, the more context we have about the market and therefore the better arguments we’re able to make to convince an HM if we spot something unrealistic upfront (I mostly do engineering for example so I know what languages can be subbed, etc), but again, our job is to find them the candidate that *they* want - not the one that we want. \n\nOn that note, I want to address what you said about making or breaking people’s lives - I think people give recruiters WAY too much credit within the hiring process. The *only* decisions we make are whether or not somebody gets an initial screening call most of the time (again, based on what the hiring manager is telling us they need).\n\nIf/when that screening call happens, I’m trying to find out if you have the skills and experience that your resume suggests, get the details on that, see if that salary we’re offering is what you’re looking for, and overall if you’re pleasant to speak with (vastly different criteria for different jobs - I’m not going to judge a remote software engineer’s communication as much as I am a sales director’s). \n\nIf all of that is good (and trust me - we WANT it to all be good; nobody likes rejecting people, nor do we like telling our HM that we have nobody for them yet), we send your resume and our notes over to the hiring manager. In most cases, THEY are the ones making the decision whether or not you move forward before they’ve even spoken to you. \n\nFrom then on, we have no say in the decision making process - we’re quite literally just the messenger. But yes, you’re absolutely correct that recruiters are responsible here, I just think you’re misunderstanding what we’re responsible *for*. Ultimately, our responsibility is as follows:\n\n1. Candidate experience - communication, trying to make sure the process is fast enough (easier said than done), and coordinating between you and the hiring team. \n\n2. Legal stuff - again, if a HM is asking for something illegal (or even just biased), we bring that to *our* manager to address. We also make sure that we’re not asking illegal questions ourselves, making sure that we let you know about any drug tests, background checks, etc so that you aren’t surprised at the end if they’re required, etc. \n\nBut decision making and requirements are completely removed from us. The ONLY exception I’ve ever seen is when you have a recruiter hiring a direct report for themselves (like a lead recruiter hiring a jr. Recruiter who will report directly to them).\n\nFinally, the timeline thing. Yeah - they always do want them hired yesterday, but that doesn’t mean that they *also* prioritize their part in getting that done. I have one sitting that was opened in early December and the HM wanted to make an offer and have the person on-boarded before Christmas… guess who STILL hasn’t made their final decision. We don’t tell candidates this obviously, but half the time y’all are asking for updates, we ALSO would like an update. This one was escalated to my manager’s manager but again… if the HM says they’re “too busy,” all we can do is keep our candidates informed and create  timeline requirements and consequences for situations like this that arise in the future. This HM will be dealt with, but this is far from an uncommon story. In their defense, we need to remember that hiring is more like project work to them - they have all of their normal work on top of it too. \n\nBut yeah, sorry for the wall of text but I hope this clarified a little!\n\nTl;dr - the recruiter’s job is to do what they’re told, the hiring manager makes the actual decisions on who gets to interview and who gets hired, and half our days are spent chasing down answers to try our best not to give y’all a shitty experience.\n\nEditing to add that I don’t want to minimize the fact that there *are* bad recruiters out there like any other job.

But yes - I’ve gone through my fair share of long unemployment stints (TWO layoffs within a 12 month period) and spent the last year working the most toxic, political, understimulating job I’ve ever worked (outside of when I was working fast food) for HALF the pay I was making in the two jobs previously. This market fucking SUCKS. I know the pain very, very well and I’m sorry that you do too!\n\nI actually became a recruiter BECAUSE I’ve seen the way that inequity begets inequity. There’s so much tied into this, so I figured that since I got the opportunity to learn the “behind the scenes” of this stupid economic/class system that we live in, and since I’m forced to participate in it, I may as well participate in a way that can help other people play within the system as well. This is *exactly* why I’m big on pushing against the degree requirements and talking to my HMs about transferable skills, different industries, etc. \n\nAnd I gotta give them credit - most of them ARE very open to more diverse experiences, and the vast majority of mine are really good with prioritizing the hiring process. But when they don’t, it leaves a bad taste in all of our mouths (I’m so thankful every day for our sr. manager though - they give them hell if/when needed). \n\nWhat I’d like to see is some really thorough unconscious bias and DEI training done throughout companies at the highest level. I know, we all hate the buzzword but I essentially I just want leadership to be aware of how certain factors (like family finances, where people grew up/live, access to industry, etc) influence what’s on a resume, but doesn’t actually translate to potential. Just because somebody didn’t get the opportunity to go to college or lived in a rural area and didn’t have access to “big” companies doesn’t mean that they’re not suited for a job, and just because your candidate doesn’t make amazing eye contact doesn’t make them rude, you know what I mean? We pretend that we live in this meritocracy, but so much of what we see as success has been influenced by factors outside of people’s control - even something as simple as never being taught how to write a resume. \n\nWhat industry are you in if you’re comfortable sharing? I know that Bonnie Dilber is a great “translator” for candidates in tech, but I do really like your idea of a dedicated space. I don’t know how we would accomplish something like that without it devolving into /r/recruitinghell (which was supposed to be a place to share egregious experiences but has now become an echo chamber of “fuck all recruiters” LOL). \n\nFeel free to let me know if you have other specific questions or ideas!

Come on, make it easier for your team to work. Do you initially how many platforms forgot to push y.? Ridiculous! \n\nBTW we also had the worst submittal process - all in the IT dept (new to company that year) were all Sr level Recruiters, yet 3 people had to approve for one submission to be sent out! 3 ppl who were out in the field 9 out of 10...Needless to say, they closed ops after 1st yr...mind you... that was the year of y2k! We made tons of money, I was credited actually for finding a source for a client who needed 101 BMT's incl PM's , not one out of the other 5 Recruiters could find candidates until I shared my source. ( happy to do it for the team! ) \n\n Unfortunately, all was in one basket, nothing planned for after y2k!
