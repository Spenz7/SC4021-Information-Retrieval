Blaming ATS is often more comfortable than facing that reality.\n\nI also mostly agree on LLMs hitting a plateau in terms of pure text quality. Where I slightly differ is that I still see a lot of untapped value for recruitment - not in “smarter writing”, but in **process relief**. For example, chatbots handling repetitive candidate questions, status updates, or basic FAQs. That kind of automation won’t revolutionize hiring, but it can meaningfully reduce manual workload for recruiters.\n\nOn data and intelligence - I read this less as “big data” and more as market awareness. In slower markets, knowing what candidates are actually saying, where pipelines break, which clients are serious, and where time is being wasted becomes a real competitive advantage.\n\nAnd on scaling down: leaner teams make sense from a business perspective, but I’m curious how this plays out long term with generational shifts. Gen Z values balance more, millennials are already burnt out - so higher productivity per head may depend less on “working harder” and more on smarter systems, automation, and realistic expectations.\n\nInteresting take overall - 2026 definitely feels like a year of fewer illusions and more pragmatism.", "timestamp": "2026-01-05T13:17:24Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Recruitment Predictions 2026", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1q4iuvy/recruitment_predictions_2026/"}}

The myth of the ATS monster will continue to grow\n\nSpeaking of IT tech recruitment: the CV concept will start to slowly fade away, the problem with it is that candidates spend time to optimize their CV, and ATS providers are spending dev cycles to summarize these AI generated CVs, but the clients want quick feedback loops from their real skills, they don't trust CVs. Assigning small practical projects will become less unreasonable ask. With AI assistance, candidates can deliver working solutions in hours rather than days. Also leetcode assessments feel increasingly disconnected from actual job requirements.  \n\n\\&gt; 2. AI, or at least LLM capabilities, will peak off.\n\nSure, so did the previous year. This rule can be easily extrapolated on the next years to come. The models are only getting better and after recent releases of Opus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 all the sceptics are embracing AI agents in their daily work. This will shift the candidates requirements to more generalist AI orchestrator. You need to learn how to find these people.\n\n\\&gt;4. Scaling down is the new scaling up.\n\nLeaner but more seniors teams are going to be the thing this year. Developers sometimes call it the great junior developer squeeze. The problem is that AI handles the grunt work that traditionally onboarded entry-level engineers. Not sure what replaces that learning path. But I think this will normalize and the companies will start onboarding juniors as AI agent orchestrators and increase spending on QA. \n\n\n\nThis all becomes very disruptive for the applicants already so it's important for recruiters to catch up.\n\nI wrote up more observations on this here: [https://githunt.ai/blog/developer-hiring-trends-2026](https://githunt.ai/blog/developer-hiring-trends-2026)", "timestamp": "2026-01-07T09:48:59Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Recruitment Predictions 2026", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1q4iuvy/recruitment_predictions_2026/"}}

Either way, 2026 does feel like a year where a lot of illusions are getting stripped away and pragmatism is taking over.", "timestamp": "2026-01-05T13:55:51Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Recruitment Predictions 2026", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1q4iuvy/recruitment_predictions_2026/"}}
{"id": "nxtnrne", "text": "Yeah, I mean, it’s really a continuation from what’s already happening in the industry.  \nWhen I started out in the game, the industry was very different. A CRM or database couldn’t be bought off the shelf for cheap, and the data to fill it with was hard to find. LinkedIn was very new at the time.\n\nSo recruitment firms were of a decent size and the giants in the industry really had power.\n\nBut these days, with the availability of tech, it’s much easier to get some experience and then start up on your own while still providing a service that is, in many cases, better than that of the multimillion-dollar turnover giants.\n\nSo over the years more and more boutique firms started up.  \nI’d say about five years ago many recruitment firms had the ambition of starting up by themselves, growing to a headcount of, say, 50 or 100 and then selling their businesses while driving their yacht into the sunset.\n\nBut that dream has slowly started to die.\n\nIt turns out that it’s actually VERY hard to scale a recruitment business beyond, say, 25 heads, especially as the moment someone realises they’re pretty good now, they can leave and set up on their own and make twice the money.\n\nSo now businesses are giving up on that dream… they’re moving down from, say, 20 or 30 heads billing an average of around 150k across the board (due to stragglers, trainees etc.), and instead want to keep their solid core of around 10 to 15 heads who bill, on average, say 250k–350k.\n\nLess overhead… more money… less stress... yeah its not really sellable, but its a solid lifestyle business that they can extract wealth from.\n\nI think we’ll see a mix. Some companies will genuinely streamline processes and use automation properly, but plenty will still use “efficiency” as a way of masking higher expectations. Over time, only the former will retain strong performers.", "timestamp": "2026-01-05T14:41:21Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Recruitment Predictions 2026", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1q4iuvy/recruitment_predictions_2026/"}}
{"id": "nxttc6v", "text": "Regarding scale, you are spot-on. I've been in the recruitment CRM SaaS space my entire career. I'm hard-pressed to think of many clients whose promise to grow from one or two seat licenses to 20 actually came true. Much of the time if you start off with two or three recruiters, you stay with two or three recruiters. People will sometimes ask for the 10+ user discount because \"we are about to grow\" :)", "timestamp": "2026-01-05T15:10:17Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Recruitment Predictions 2026", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1q4iuvy/recruitment_predictions_2026/"}}
