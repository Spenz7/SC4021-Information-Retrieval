{"id": "mnc4qup", "text": "The word embellish stood out to me as a potential conflict due to misalignment of shared meaning. When I use AI to write it is never to “invent” experience and skills that are not represented in my background. I may give note weight to one over the main skill if I’m trying to position myself better. But I always include in my prompt for the AI to not invent experience or transfer experience or achievements from one role to another. I can show how they stack but do not want them misrepresenting anything I can’t back up. I\n\nI approach writing from the stand point of wanting to be certain the words I’m using are accurate for how is being used. My vocabulary as a result is broader than average and I try to use it as often as possible.\n\nBut candidates are getting the message that AI is ok for the orgs to use but not for candidates. It’s a double standard which may not reflect what is actually held as values for either side. But the misperception is driving a wedge of resentment that is also a liability. Innovation and success are fundamentally incompatible with suspicion and assumptions of mal intent from either side.", "timestamp": "2025-04-16T01:30:56Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Using AI detector technology as a recruiter?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1jxijs6/using_ai_detector_technology_as_a_recruiter/"}}
