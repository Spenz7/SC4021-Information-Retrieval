{"id": "mxok9zk", "text": "Some of the key patterns I noticed for these types of applicants with my current postings (some already mentioned here):\n\n - resume has an unusually high match to the job description, sometimes even aligning to the same industry, a competitive or similar product, or environment (dream candidate)\n- strange metadata on the resume. For Word resumes, it might show a different author, for PDFs, they’re authored with MS Word 2016\n- unusually generated emails such as “name.dev@ gmail” or “name.number@gmail”, or “name.work/companyname@gmail”\n- strange formatting emphasizing or highlights all key skills and matching criteria/experience \n- no LinkedIn or new LI profile with limited connections and/or activity\n\nI realize that many of the above criteria individually can be very common such as using ChatGPT to better match your resume, or creating an email specific to your job search, but with most of the threat actor resumes we get, we see some version of all these “yellow flags” for each applicant. \n\nHope this helps!", "timestamp": "2025-06-14T03:20:06Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "What’s with the fake candidates?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1l9nxcl/whats_with_the_fake_candidates/"}}

{"id": "mxr50iu", "text": "Totally understand your point. Just note I never mentioned eliminating them, I flag as “possible threat actors” so we’re on high alert if we choose to still proceed with them. Live video is a must, we also do direct handoffs (as an intro) with remote video interviews to ensure it’s the same person throughout the process. We’re also paying extremely close attention to key details about their surrounding, their responses, issues with video feed etc.  To give credit, these exercises are incredibly sophisticated and beyond annoying. \n\nAs mentioned above, any one of those things could be legitimate on their own - such as in your example, someone using another person’s computer to create a resume or having a resume service/coach would easily explain why an author doesn’t match. But with most of the threat actor applicants we see, we see several if not all of these “yellow flags” at the same time. And usually, the author isn’t just a different name, it’s usually some weird coded label like “winner resume, python script xxxx, sample code resume, etc.” \n\nThis is just my experience that I’m sharing as I currently deal with this challenge.", "timestamp": "2025-06-14T15:21:54Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "What’s with the fake candidates?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1l9nxcl/whats_with_the_fake_candidates/"}}

{"id": "mxyrcx2", "text": "Hi OP!\n\nIt's quite frustrating to deal with fake candidates. Shiny resumes, but they can't back their experience up. I have personally taken hundreds of interviews, and it happens again and again. It just sucks up our time and energy. \n\nWe are solving this exact problem using AI, reasoning at scale. After the candidate uploads their resume, we analyze patterns in the resume and ask candidates questions to clear things up, we call it pre screening. Later, we rank candidates based on their resume + pre-screening, taking job description in context.\n\nWould love to walk you through our product! https://AgentR.global", "timestamp": "2025-06-15T20:14:16Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "What’s with the fake candidates?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1l9nxcl/whats_with_the_fake_candidates/"}}
