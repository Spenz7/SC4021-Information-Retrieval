I explained my experiments in the previous lab and what I hope to learn in his lab.\n\nAt the end of the interview he asked if I knew the director of my previous lab passed away.  I said no I've been overseas studying at this university for 2 years and have rarely been in contact with my former lab mates.\n\nI guess he accepted my answer because I was hired the next day.\n\nSo have your potential hire mention through a few names in his follow up interview, then ask your friend if those people have worked there.\n\nMy 2nd experience was with a childhood ex-gf who has done very well for herself.
