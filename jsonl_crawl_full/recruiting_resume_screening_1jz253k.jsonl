You're not allowed to attempt to judge or \"guess\" what disabilities someone may have but at the same time you're not allowed to reject someone if they have disabilities.

Later on within a day or so suddenly I get a rejection letter. Now mind you the in-person interview went about the same as the phone one and was with the same manager but the only difference is she could see me and that I was overweight. Never mind I had done the same exact work I was applying for for like 15 years and clearly had no physical issues doing the job. \n\nNormally I don't get suspicious but it was so strange that she seemed so keen on hiring me until she met me in person, so I just this once contacted their HR department relayed to them my experience up to that point and asked for feedback as to why I was ultimately rejected. When they finally got back to me they said the store manager claimed I had used inappropriate language during our interview which is something I have never done in my entire life. So basically at that point I knew she made something up. \n\nWhile I can't 100% prove she changed her mind based on my weight, it sure is suspect that she absolutely loved me and my personality over the phone and then all of a sudden wasn't interested when she saw me in person. And yes I was well groomed and dressed nice and all that sort of thing, so I know it wasn't anything along the lines of looking disheveled or whatever. Literally the only difference was seeing my weight and how I looked.", "timestamp": "2025-04-15T00:27:54Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Candidate got stuck in chair during interview - Security were called to help him out and it’s caused a whole ordeal", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1jz253k/candidate_got_stuck_in_chair_during_interview/"}}

{"id": "mn4ned7", "text": "Years ago I was conducting a retained executive search for a C-Suite senior role for an extremely visible position for a healthcare company. Candidates who met the requirements were scarce as hens teeth, and we had eliminated almost all of them. \n\nSo, you can imagine how I was ecstatic when a researcher stormed into my office and told me they had found the perfect candidate. I reviewed the resume and their extensive notes from conversations with the individual. I could not believe it, but they appeared to have done it, the guy met every criteria. After a lengthy phone interview, I arranged to fly to Boston and meet with him in person. I had to change my schedule for the week to make it work, but I didn’t want to risk losing this guy. \n\nWe were to meet for breakfast at 7 AM at my hotel by the airport and I was there early eagerly anticipating the meeting. Shortly after the appointed time I looked up to see the hostess leading a man through the restaurant to my table. I swallowed hard as I watched this man, at least 450 to 500 pounds of sweating hulk in a suit waddle behind her. She introduced him to me and left, and the man sat down, promptly breaking the right arm off his chair. It wasn’t a dream, it was actually happening to me! \n\nSomehow, we managed to order and start talking. As they were bringing the food I smelled a foul odor and thought it was coming from the server. I was wrong! After they left and I started to eat the smell came back and was stronger. It was so pungent I finally had to quit eating or risk throwing up. The man had the worst case of horrible body odor that I  have ever seen. I endured the interview and found that, professionally speaking, the man was extremely talented. \n\nWe closed the interview and I rushed to Logan to catch the next flight West. The flight attendant looked at me strangely when I asked for two double Black Jack’s on the rocks, and it wasn’t even noon. I couldn’t tell her!\n\nUnderstandably, I had to red line the guy as a candidate. Further research told us that he had been terminated from at least his last two executive positions because of issues with personal hygiene. \n\nThere is some good news. A few years later I learned that the man entered counseling and had bariatric surgery. Both were successful in significantly improving his life.", "timestamp": "2025-04-14T21:13:40Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Candidate got stuck in chair during interview - Security were called to help him out and it’s caused a whole ordeal", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1jz253k/candidate_got_stuck_in_chair_during_interview/"}}
