It’s *not* an ATS, it’s an *AI* ATS. You know the marketing adage about selling benefits, not features? You’re already selling AI this and AI that, *not* the actual feature. \n\nEither you have a clear, simple vision for a refreshing product, and your going to bloat it to hell with likely useless AI gimmicks - or you *don’t* have any clear vision, and your building a confused mess with some AI gimmicks thrown in because…. AI, right? \n\nEven in your post above, you’re frustrated with the way the current systems work, but rather than talking about solving any of the pain you’ve felt first hand.. AI, AM I RIGHT?!\n\nThis is why your product will fail. \n\nYou’re already *so* obsessed with the hype that you can’t see what you’re actually trying to build. \n\nDo you know what would solve most of what you’re describing? A fast system with a lightweight  super usable UI that’s easy to use, gets out the way, and *doesn’t* try to do everything - with a clear, straightforward pricing model.\n\nSeriously, ban the word AI from your office.

{"id": "nh0xaef", "text": "This is a fantastic, brutally honest take, and I genuinely appreciate you taking the time to write it. Seriously. This is exactly the kind of unfiltered feedback that is so hard to get and so valuable.\n\nYou've hit on some points that are 100% valid. I can absolutely see how my post comes across as leading with the \"AI\" buzzword instead of the actual problems. That's a fair cop, and your point about selling benefits, not features (or in this case, the tech behind the features), is well-taken.\n\nLet me try and reframe, because you're right, the vision isn't about 'AI for AI's sake'. It's about using it to solve the specific, soul-crushing admin tasks that I, and many others, have dealt with first-hand.\n\nFor example:\n\n* The first-hand pain is spending the first two hours of your day manually sifting through 150+ irrelevant applications for a single role. The benefit we're building is getting a prioritized shortlist of the top 10 most relevant candidates instantly, so you can start your day by actually speaking to people who are a good fit.\n* The pain is having conversations happening across email, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and SMS, and trying to keep track of it all. The benefit is having a single, unified inbox that consolidates it all, with an assistant that can suggest replies or schedule the interview directly from the conversation thread.\n* The pain is finishing a 45-minute video call and then spending another 15 minutes typing up notes. The benefit is having that call automatically transcribed, summarized, and key action items added to your to-do list before you've even closed the Zoom window.\n\nYou've absolutely nailed what the foundation of any good system should be: **\"A fast system with a lightweight super usable UI that’s easy to use, gets out the way, and doesn’t try to do everything - with a clear, straightforward pricing model.\"**\n\nThat is our ground zero. If the core ATS/CRM isn't incredibly fast and intuitive, then any extra features, AI-powered or not, are just lipstick on a pig. The goal is to build that solid foundation first and then use the tech to eliminate the manual work that gets in the way of recruiters actually recruiting.\n\nYour advice to \"ban the word AI\" is ringing in my ears. While we won't ban the tech itself, this is a very strong reminder for us to ban it from our *messaging* and focus purely on the problems we solve and the time we save.\n\nThis was genuinely helpful.

{"id": "nh5w25d", "text": "I agree with you 100% on the foundation. The absolute priority has to be a **clean, fast, and intuitive CRM that just works**. If the core system is clunky, nothing else matters. Your decision to opt for that proves that many new platforms are failing on this basic, essential promise.\n\nWhere I'd offer a bit of pushback is on the idea that it has to be a choice between a 'simple CRM' and an 'AI platform'. The problem is that AI is often treated as a flashy, separate 'feature' that you have to go out of your way to use, which is what makes it feel cumbersome and bloated.\n\nMy belief is that when it's done right, AI should be almost invisible. It shouldn't feel like an extra task. It should be woven into the background of your existing workflow, simply removing the friction.\n\nFor example:\n\n* You shouldn't have to click a \"Parse CV with AI\" button. You should just upload a CV, and the candidate's profile, skills, and experience timeline are automatically and accurately filled out for you. You didn't do an extra step; a step was just removed from your process.\n* You shouldn't have to navigate to a separate \"AI screening\" module. When you drag a candidate into your \"screening\" pipeline stage, the system should simply ask, \"Want to send them the video screening questions for this role?\". It’s an intelligent layer on top of an action you were already taking.\n* The goal isn't to make recruiters use 'AI features'. The goal is to make the 50 small, annoying admin tasks they do every day simply disappear into the background.\n\nYour experience sounds like a perfect example of what happens when that seamless integration isn't quite there yet. It highlights the massive gap between a cool tech demo and a tool that genuinely makes your day easier without being a burden. This is exactly the tightrope we're trying to walk.", "timestamp": "2025-10-01T10:42:21Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Building a new ATS / CRM with actual AI superpowers.

There can be a huge gap between a slick website and a tool that actually delivers on the day-to-day grind.\n\nThe existence of competitors doesn't change my core question to this community: **What are the fundamental problems that are** ***still*** **not being solved to your satisfaction?**\n\nCompetition is healthy; it pushes the entire industry forward.

The amount of time recruiters spend just on the admin between conversations is practically a second job.\n\nAnd the Stardex examples for biz dev and personalising outreach are spot on. It's all about getting rid of the grunt work so you can spend more time actually talking to people and building relationships.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of stuff I was hoping to hear about. Not just a generic \"we use AI,\" but a specific, annoying task that a tool can actually solve well.
