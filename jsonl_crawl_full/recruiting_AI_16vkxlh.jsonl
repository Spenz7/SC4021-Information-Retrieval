AI will make engineers more efficient and as a result, reduce the need for the overall volume of engineers in the future vs. today or the past\n2. AI will, in turn, make very effective engineers superstars, and average engineers obsolete (the cream will rise to the top, just like it does now)\n3. As a result this will raise the bar for what constitutes a “top” engineer, increasing their demand. \n4. This will lead to increased wages for the top engineers in the future. Due to AI making engineering more accessible and engineers more effective, it also means that more engineers will enter the market. Under this circumstance, there are lots of engineers, all paid on a sliding scale. Attrition and job transfers are impossible to ignore at this point. \n\nFor your thesis to work (recruiting is going away because it will do the job of an engineer) would indicate that AI will replace engineers altogether. AI will require a human operator to guide it and that person will need an engineering foundation. If it doesn’t, then you can become an engineer \n\nOn the point about AI actually replacing a recruiter:\n\n1. AI isn’t going to irradiate recruiters…it’s going to create a new category for what the profession looks \n2. Bad recruiters (transactional, lazy ones) will get pushed out immediately. Good ones will stay average, for a little while. The great ones will pull away. \n3.
