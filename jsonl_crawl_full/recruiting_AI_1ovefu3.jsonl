I went through this exact evaluation at BlinkRx when we were around that size.\n\nFor sourcing-heavy teams, I'd look at Gem or Dover first - they're built differently than traditional ATS platforms. Gem especially has that Chrome extension that lets you source directly from LinkedIn and automatically syncs everything back. Dover's more AI-forward if that's your thing. Both handle the basics like job posting distribution but their real strength is the outreach workflows. You can set up sequences, track open rates, all that stuff. The UI on both is pretty clean too, not like those old school ATS systems that look like they were designed in 2005.\n\nIf you want something more traditional but still modern, Ashby's worth checking out. Their sourcing isn't as robust as Gem but the overall platform is super flexible - you can basically configure it however you want. Plus they have decent integrations with HRIS systems if you end up needing that later. Greenhouse is obviously the safe choice but honestly at your size it might be overkill. One thing though - whatever you pick, make sure they have good candidate experience features.

But heads up on the LinkedIn suspension risk that TheSquanderingJew mentioned - it's real. We had a recruiter get a warning.\n\nOne system that hasn't come up yet is Deliveru Recruiting AI (Resume AI)- we've been using it since June and it's been solid for our use case. The resume parsing is honestly the best I've seen (catches stuff other systems miss completely), and the sourcing workflows are pretty clean. Not as feature-heavy as Greenhouse but way easier to get your team onboarded. The AI filtering actually works unlike some others that just do keyword matching.\n\nMain pros from my experience: - Set up in like 2 days vs weeks for Greenhouse - The parsing accuracy saved us tons of manual review time - Sourcing interface is intuitive enough that our hiring managers actually use it - Pricing scaled reasonably as we grew (important for startups)\n\nCons to consider: - Less integrations than Greenhouse/Ashby - Reporting could be more robust - Support is good but not 24/7\n\nIf you're doing heavy sourcing, I'd trial both Gem and Deliveru. Gem for the LinkedIn workflow, Deliveru if you want something that handles the full cycle better.

You can scale as you grow without paying enterprise prices.\n\nLever - very clean UI, strong CRM-style pipeline and integrations. Great if you expect to scale fast, though a bit pricier.\n\nWorkable - solid all-in-one tool, AI screening, job board distribution, and some HR features. Good if you want a smooth workflow now and room to grow.\n\nFor a small team hiring 5–10 people this year, I’d probably start with Hire-inc since it hits most must-haves without overcomplicating things and it is targeted for smaller companies/startups.

It’s lightweight enough for a small startup, but it has the big-team features you’ll eventually need:  \n• ATS with clean UI  \n• one-click job posting  \n• skill-based screening tools  \n• async video + assessment suite  \n• AI-assisted filtering so you’re not spending your nights reading random CVs  \n  \nReferrals are supported, and integrations are straightforward if you already use HRIS tools.  \n  \nIf you want something that won’t drown your team in complexity but still gives you actual filtering power instead of noise, an ATS with built-in assessments and async screening tends to scale the smoothest.
