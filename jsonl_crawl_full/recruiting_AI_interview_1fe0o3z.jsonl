So I googled them, looking for the listing I used to apply. I couldn't find it, but did find listings that I hadn't used to apply - the money was different for the same position. Third red flag. \nBONUS FLAG - you need to pay them $3.25 a day to cover your costs for 60 days. Fourth red flag. \n\nDo not pay for a job. Do not pay for training for a job.
