{"id": "nfzbzee", "text": "Yikes.  Sounds like you’ve had a few bad experiences.  Sorry if that’s the case.  All recruiters are not bad. \n\nI’ve been a recruiter since early 1997… just as the internet was becoming mainstream but everything was still all in person.  I loved that era!\n\nIt was completely random how I became a recruiter - I never planned it.  I think that’s the case for many recruiters.  \n\nI didn’t have a degree back then  - I had just gotten out of the Marines after serving 9 years on active duty.  The temp/staffing agency hired me as an internal employee, on the spot the day I walked into their office. \n\nI’ve been a tech recruiter off and on since 2012 - including big tech for the past 6 years.  I finished my BS degree in Business &amp; Marketing in 2016 after many years taking classes here and there.  It was a personal goal but I also wanted to make my husband and 3 kids proud.  \n\nNever think of myself as god and I never have the final say in pay or offers for candidates.  \n\nIf I did, I would actually make HM’s hire candidates that were best qualified for their jobs, instead of candidates they push to hire because they know and like them.  \n\nReally it’s the HM’s that final decide who to hire - it’s who they want, especially in corporate recruiting.  \n\nSometimes I influence my HM’s but mostly they hire who they want and “KNOW” they know better than me. \n\nAs for comp, I always do my best to get candidate the most they can get and encourage them to negotiate.  It sucks to join a company and find out you got screwed for pay compared to your co-workers and/or same level hires.  \n\nI was an agency recruiter for 10 years before I went in-house.  As an agency recruiter, I had a ton of influence and control over comp and best candidates for the job.  Likely because clients paid a premium for my expertise so they had more respect for my input.  \n\nIn all my years as a recruiter, I still don’t know everything.  That’s what I love most about it - I’m always learning new things and meeting new people.\n\nBig Tech recruiting is my least favorite because there are so many oversized egos, it’s very cut throat and not team oriented.\n\nAfter recruiting for almost every industry, in both in-house and agency recruiting, agency will always be my favorite.", "timestamp": "2025-09-24T17:21:44Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Tech recruiting has changed", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1nnx24s/tech_recruiting_has_changed/"}}
{"id": "nfzeg7x", "text": "Thanks for the response. One of the most sane and not so pompous recruiters I have come across. In early 2000’s, we had administrative assistants compile resumes and give it to the team on who they want to call for the interviews. No filtering done by recruiters and technical team would do the filtering as they know better. Now a days recruiter believes they know the “ tech” and ask questions as part of their screening. I have seen it on both sides where they filter and provide resume where the person they forwarded doesn’t have the skills or they missed out getting resume of a certain person because receruiter had no clue. I have seen it internally in big tech I work for more often and also heard  from friends in other big tech companies. \n\nI would rather recruiter be the administrative  assistants as in olden days where they don’t become the filter to screen resumes as 1. The are not qualified to do so and 2. They are much better in coordinating interviews and schedules after the team decides who they want to call for interviews. \n\nPost interview, in the early days, the hiring manager would typically call the candidate to make an offer very quickly. These days, recruiter has to get back and more often than not they either ghost you or come back and talk in a take it or leave it tone. In early 2000, you are talking to hiring manager about the offer and details and much more personable. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, I don’t see the use of recruiter at all unless they have a technical background or degree  to recruit tech candidates.
