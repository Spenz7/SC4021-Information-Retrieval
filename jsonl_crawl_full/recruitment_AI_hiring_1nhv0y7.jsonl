{"id": "ng2ks7x", "text": "I've been deep in this space for a while and honestly the AI screening tools are really hit or miss right now. Most of them are solid at weeding out the obvious no's but they struggle with nuanced candidates who might not fit the traditional mold but could be amazing hires. You end up missing out on people with unconventional backgrounds or career paths who bring fresh perspectives. The tools tend to favor candidates who know how to game the system rather than those with genuine potential. For skill-based screening, Promap for example focuses on assessments &amp; AI screening that's recorded so you see the questions &amp; answers, vs. a black box.\n\nThe key things I'd watch out for are tools that claim they eliminate bias completely (spoiler alert: they don't, they just shift it around) and anything with black box scoring that you cant explain to candidates later. Make sure whatever you pick lets you easily override the AI decisions because you'll need to do that more often than you think. Also consider your volume and team size because some tools are overkill for smaller operations while others don't scale well for high volume hiring.", "timestamp": "2025-09-25T04:09:32Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Recruiters - what software do you use to screen applicants?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1nhv0y7/recruiters_what_software_do_you_use_to_screen/"}}
