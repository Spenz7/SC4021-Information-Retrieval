They might filter out using keywords, or just literally playing lottery odds and auto rejecting half of them.\n\nSo now you're down to 500 applications, you start looking them over very briefly.  Tossing anything that doesn't light up as immediately checking all the boxes.  And this is just for one position.  You still have stacks of 5000 for a dozen other positions you have to hire for.\n\nThink how you'd go about handling this situation.  To me it really feels like even if you're perfectly qualified for a job, you still have to win a lottery against a few hundred other applicants.  And theres really no way to tell who's slightly better than another candidate from a piece of paper.  And you don't really have all the time in the world to interview 500 people.\n\nSo yeah, I'd just assume it's all basically a lottery.

{"id": "iiebesb", "text": "There are a few reasons, but I think one of the big ones is that applicants are so used to BS (for example, the personality tests that make very little sense) that when someone sold AI as useful for applicant ranking and filtering (Probably someone  who was trying to sell their ATS based on buzzwords, as happens way too often when people sell tech. Oh here's an advertisement for using it in general: https://www.skeeled.com/blog/why-you-need-an-ats-that-is-ai-powered), people latched onto that idea as a \"Fuck. ATS are doing this now and we gotta deal with that too\". \n\nBecause there's no way to tell which recruiters use AI to analyze keywords, there's no way for applicants to know how necessary it is to combat AI resume analysis. Because applicants know positions get probably about as many applications per day as they apply to jobs per day (some of those jobs being fake listings), they also know it's probably impractical to actually look at every resume.\n\nThus it seems logical that there would be an early elimination round that's managed by the computer.", "timestamp": "2022-07-31T16:21:02Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Beating the ATS.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/wc3d8y/beating_the_ats/"}}
