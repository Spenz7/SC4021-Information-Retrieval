{"id": "lwtzg8f", "text": "I think your concept sounds promising, especially as a tool to streamline the initial stages of the recruitment process! For many recruiters, saving time in the early screening steps is crucial. Here’s my perspective:\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n1. **Efficiency in Screening**: Passive screening is a smart approach for quickly narrowing down a large pool of candidates. By automating responses to standard questions, recruiters can get insights without the endless scheduling and calls.\n2. **Consistent Evaluation**: By asking the same questions, it ensures fairness and allows for easier comparison among candidates. This standardization can improve the objectivity of initial screenings.\n3. **Candidate Passion**: Video responses offer a chance to spot the candidates who truly stand out in terms of enthusiasm and communication skills—traits that may not always come through in a resume alone.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n\n1. **Tech Challenges**: There’s always a risk that tech hiccups, either on the candidate’s side or within the tool itself, could complicate the process. Ensuring it’s as user-friendly as possible will be essential.\n2. **Loss of Personal Touch**: While automation is efficient, it’s true that a real-time conversation sometimes reveals nuances that a video might not. For certain roles, this personal touch can still be valuable, so perhaps a hybrid approach would work best.\n\nAll in all, this sounds like a great tool for high-volume recruiting or for companies with limited hiring support. I’d be interested to see how it evolves and if it could integrate seamlessly with other ATS systems to streamline the whole recruitment pipeline.

{"id": "nehwf7m", "text": "Yeah, screening automation is the key when you’re drowning in 100s of resumes, cause time is money.  \n  \nWe tried a couple of those “video Q&amp;A” tools. Ngl it's a cool idea but messy when not tied to your ATS.  \n  \nAfter lot of trial and error we found Recruit CRM which kinda solved this for us: you set up screening workflows, auto-send questions/templates, and all responses drop back into the candidate profile.  \n  \nCandidates get the same consistent experience, recruiters don’t waste hours chasing calls.  \n  \nPlus you can tag/score answers, track who’s actually engaged, and push top matches straight to clients.  \n  \nIt’s not replacing interviews, rather it’s filtering noise so we spend real convos on the right people.  \n  \nGreat for candidate experience + recruiter efficiency in one.", "timestamp": "2025-09-16T09:46:38Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Does anyone here user any screening automation tools?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/yxpe91/does_anyone_here_user_any_screening_automation/"}}

{"id": "k1di6mi", "text": "* Mate, hats off to you for diving into the tech pool to make our lives a tad bit easier! Sourcing made easy :)  \nNow, here's my two cents about your innovation:  \nAbsolutely, I'd use it!  \n1. Time-saver: The idea of passive screening is like having a virtual assistant who does the initial legwork, saving us from the back-and-forth of scheduling calls. Basically, an extra pair of hands, which we all know is a recruiter's dream come true!  \n2. Consistency: Asking the same set of questions to all candidates? That's what we call a standardized format, making the comparison fair and square. It's a neat way to level the playing field and judge candidates on the same parameters.  \n3. Spotting the passionate ones: [Video interviews](https://recruitcrm.io/blogs/recruitcrm-exclusives/one-way-video-interviews/?utm_source=reddit+&amp;utm_medium=reddit+organic+syndication&amp;utm_campaign=011-+HIKquestions) and answers can be a window to gauge the candidate's enthusiasm and passion, which, sometimes, a resume fails to convey. It will probably feel like a mini 'meet the candidate' session before the actual interview.  \n**Why I might hesitate**  \n1. Tech hiccups: As much as technology is a boon, it comes with its own set of glitches. I'd be a bit wary about potential tech hiccups disrupting the smooth flow of the process.  \n2. Personal touch: While automation is great, I'd miss the personal touch and the spontaneous responses that a telephonic conversation brings to the table. It's those little nuances that sometimes help in making a decision.  \nAll in all, your tool sounds like a promising step towards bringing a fresh perspective to traditional methods, and I'm all for innovation and efficiency.  \nWould love to see how it shapes up!
