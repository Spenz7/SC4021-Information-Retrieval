I'd love to hear what are some topics that interest you.  Perhaps I can write some more about those topics.\n\nI've had another post recently [about utilizing sentence transformers and word embedding to semanticly match job titles](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/recruiterjonathonpalmieri_hcm-java-onnx-activity-7137933226819407872-qX1j?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop) for a systems integration I was working on.

It would provide a level of confidence in the answers and based on a range of confidence and the answer response it would add the profile to my recruiter project or hide them if they were a definite no. All of that was populated into an excel sheet so that I could see if they were yes, no, or maybe. I compared that to doing it manually and would grade the effectiveness around 80%.

{"id": "kyxy54m", "text": "For those who don't know, AI Agents, AKA Intelligent Agents (IA), are essentially surrogate workers that \"perceive\" the environment and then take action autonomously. A few great opensource examples are [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT), [XAgent](https://github.com/OpenBMB/XAgent), [aiwaves-cn agents](https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents), and [APPAgents](https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents)\n\nThe potential for these IA's is incredible. If given a strong LLM fine-tuned and trained to a specific task, with clear instruction, these AI-powered automation have the potential to streamline, augment, or even absorb certain roles/responsibilities. However, I think there are some rather large caveats to this which include \n\n1. Hardware, software, infrastructure, and labor limitations\n\n2. Training data, techniques, and creating effective models is difficult and may often be task specific\n\n3.  Lack of AI model decision transparency, hallucinations and misinformation, nad lack of effective evaluation  leading to operational, financial and legal liability exposure.   \n  \nMy post was too long so I am going to include explanations of these below in another comment.\n\nSo, back to your question about AI Agents leading to layoffs. I don't think (currently) there is any bigger threat to AI causing layoffs than any other type of automation, integration, or technology implementation in the business world. Instead, I think AI and other advancements in technology are going to shift the labor markets into requiring higher-skilled and/or more agile labor. AI, at least in the short run, will be amazing at augmenting workforces, including recruitment &amp; HR. Still, along the way, there are going to be many companies (like we see with all kinds of technology) that fumble and are hurt over utilizing AI. You also have to remember that many companies and industries still use Excel or paper notebooks as their business software. Large organizations with million-dollar ERP implementations still have large portions of workers and leaders working outside of and around the systems. \n\nMy final point in this long response is that Talent / Labor/ Workforce, or whatever you want to call it, is still a very antiquated area of business—leaving the talent acquisition, talent management, talent development, and talent/people analytics area, collectively the HCM space, prime for advancements. I think our role will (is) fundamentally change(ing) as TA becomes more involved in workforce planning, succession planning, retention/turnover, learning &amp; development, benefits, and the overall HR shared service model. AI is going to be useful in augmenting and advancing human capital management, but I don't think we are close to it taking our jobs. ", "timestamp": "2024-04-10T16:35:31Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "AI in Recruitment &amp; Talent Acquisition", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1bzwpn6/ai_in_recruitment_talent_acquisition/"}}
{"id": "kyxy5ve", "text": "1. Training language models (currently) is costly, time-consuming, and requires specific in-demand technical skills and large. Currently, there are limitations on hardware, power, and skilled labor. For example, Microsoft wanted to [train GPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/12jp1oo/timelines_are_being_reduced_microsoft_will_have/)6, but it couldn't colocate all of the [Nvidia h100 GPU servers required to train GPT6 because all of those servers would crash the local power grid](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/03/28/news-ai-confronts-an-energy-crisis-electricity-may-have-emerged-as-a-challenge/). So, now they have technical issues with how to train a model across data centers, requiring novel techniques and data connectivity/streaming to be able to accomplish it. This requires more skilled labor. However, it also pushes advances in hardware, such as the competition between Nvidia's H100 and the competitor AMD MI300x. We can see all kinds of chip advancements from this, such as Google ARM data center processors, AI-specific GPUs and processors, etc. However, there is still a huge cost barrier of entry and a limitation in the skills, materials, and infrastructure to support these advancements. Overall, my point here is that the advancements are happening, but there are also many limitations to mass adoption and effective utilization. There are some really interesting points about [AI creating further inequality because the wealthy and large organizations are likely the ones on the cutting edge](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity#:~:text=In%20most%20scenarios%2C%20AI%20will,retraining%20programs%20for%20vulnerable%20workers.) (so you should be supporting local LLMs and open-source AI). \n2. As much as people think LLMs are magic, they are grounded in training data, structure/layers, quantization, instructions, and prompts. As the Navy seals say, \"Under pressure, you don't rise to the occasion. You sink to the level of your training. This means they tend to be good at broad tasks or tasks specific to their training data but still struggle with critical thinking, handling structured data /math, hallucinations, etc. To train effective models, you require very specific data (preferably structured and organized). IMO, this is why we are seeing more form-fit models or SME-type trained models like Mixtral of Experts ([Mixtral 8x7b](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1)). This also brings in another issue, which is that many of these models use the same, similar, or mixed training data, which means they are often producing similar results or perpetuating problems. We will see more of this as people train AI based on open-source (OSINT) data, which will usually include bot and AI-generated content perpetuating artificial or ineffective training data. That was the big joke when Elon was talking about using X(Twitter) data for training. People laughed, saying they didn't want bot content to train their AI bot. Finally, this brings the problem of evaluating LLMs, which has caused a stir in the value of LLM Leaderboards and evaluation ratings. Most models aim to perform well on the evaluations and often train using evaluation data. We essentially digitized the \"teach to the test\" dilemma. \n3. The final caveat of AI agents is that there is little to no transparency as to why a LLM takes a specific action. Therefore, some oversight still needs to be done. Otherwise, you are opening your company up to huge liability and financial exposures. I am sure we will see a big company in our lifetime that will almost go under due to overreliance on AI or employment liability claims from Bias derived from the use of AI. This will secure many of our jobs. It also always makes me think of the [30 Rock episode where Jack fires all of the NBC pages to use an AI system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Kenneth_Parcell). Then when things go wrong he (the executive) has no underling to blame. ", "timestamp": "2024-04-10T16:35:38Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "AI in Recruitment &amp; Talent Acquisition", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1bzwpn6/ai_in_recruitment_talent_acquisition/"}}
