{"id": "lg00o2i", "text": "Fetcher is one of those tools that has been getting a lot of buzz lately. It uses AI to help streamline sourcing by identifying and reaching out to candidates that fit your job requirements. The idea is that it saves you time by automating the initial sourcing and engagement process.\n\nFrom what I have seen, people who have used Fetcher appreciate its ability to cut down on the manual work of sourcing. It’s super helpful if you are dealing with a high volume of roles to fill.\n\nThe AI does a decent job of learning from your feedback on candidates, which means the quality of matches tends to improve over time.\n\nHowever, like with any AI tool, it's not perfect. Some users have mentioned that the initial candidate quality can vary, and it takes some time to really dial in what you are looking for. It’s also important to keep giving feedback to the system so it learns and improves.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a tool to help with the heavy lifting of sourcing, Fetcher might be worth a try. Just keep in mind that you might need to invest a bit of time upfront to get the best results.\n\nHope this helps!", "timestamp": "2024-08-01T16:45:07Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "How effective is AI in recruitment?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/10p3tr9/how_effective_is_ai_in_recruitment/"}}
