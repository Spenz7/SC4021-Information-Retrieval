{"id": "mobq1pl", "text": "I posted this on another post this morning, and think other remote hiring companies should try this strategy.\n\nOne way of getting these fake applicants is to add an application question saying that you require an in-person interview. My company is doing this before we extend the offer. Honestly, just saying this may be enough to deter them from applying, but if they don’t plan to show up to speak with the team in person, it’s a no-go for us. I emphasize this in the recruiter screen and it’s been working like a charm thus far. I’ve had a handful of people who get on a screen and seemed very shady, but I didn’t want to outright judge them. As soon as I mention the mandatory office visit, they bail from the call or ghost afterward with my follow up emails. They know our process is locked down.", "timestamp": "2025-04-21T21:29:39Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Tech Recruiters: Running into scam engineering candidates?

{"id": "mvzf3rc", "text": "2 months late to the party but I’ve been experiencing the exact same thing over the past few months. Initially, we were hiring in Pakistan, and I'd get candidates with clearly local Pakistani names — but then they show up to the interview and it’s a completely different person, usually Chinese. It was so frequent that we eventually shifted our focus to hiring in the Philippines… and, unbelievably, the same thing started happening there too.\n\nI’ve even taken to screenshotting these interviews and sharing them with the hiring managers on our team just to show how bizarre it’s gotten. Like you mentioned — pixelated video, generic or overly polished answers, fake resumes with names that don’t match the person, and zero digital footprint beyond LinkedIn. It really feels like some kind of organized operation, whether it's proxy interviews or fake identities trying to get hired under false pretenses.\n\nWe’re now leaning more heavily on internal referrals because it's taking way too much time and energy to sift through what feels like fraud. I don’t know what the long-term solution is either, but it’s definitely becoming a real issue in remote hiring.", "timestamp": "2025-06-04T17:09:12Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Tech Recruiters: Running into scam engineering candidates?
