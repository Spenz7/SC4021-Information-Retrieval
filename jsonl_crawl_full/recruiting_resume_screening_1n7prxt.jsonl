{"id": "nday8t9", "text": "Honestly, the cleanest way is to just make the location requirement unavoidable. Put it front and center in the JD: “This role is 100% onsite in \\[City\\]. Candidates must already live within commuting distance,  no relocation/remote considered.”  \nSince your ATS doesn’t have knockout questions, just build it into the first step. Quick auto-email or screener call: “Are you currently based within commuting distance of \\[office location\\]?” - Yes/No. That way you’re filtering based on logistics, not assumptions about someone’s background.  \nOn screening calls, confirm location before you go anywhere else. Saves everyone time and keeps you compliant.
