It was down to the two of us, they loved us both, would hire us both if they could...blah blah. OK fine, I appreciated it. I told the recruiter that because my job hunting experience has been brutal, and any communication at all is appreciated. She then asked me to relay that to the company because positive feedback to her client would be good for her, and she went on about the struggles recruiters are facing and how hard rejection calls can be. Look, I get it, but at that moment, I just wanted off the phone to cry. It was so awkward. \n\nCalls can be a good thing, but remember you calling humans with stressful news.
