Which I understand to a point, there are terrible recruiters out there and I know people have bad experiences with them.

I look at the resume, he has 5 years engineering experience but no engineering degree. Gave him a call, tried to dive further into that experience because you never know, maybe he’s strong enough to negate the degree requirement. He answered broadly with no technical detail and when I dug in further he said that he would speak with the hiring manager in more detail and that he was sure that his resume would get him an interview. I thanked him for his time and said I would share his resume. \n\nThe hiring manager is reasonable, but the resume had no where enough technical detail to justify considering him for the role and I didn’t have any more detail to push back on his decision not to speak with the candidate. For all I know he could’ve inflated the experience in the bullets he listed since he wasn’t able to speak to them. \n\nI just wish candidates understood that when we’re asking them questions it helps them in the long run. Recruiters want to hire people, there’s no reason for us to  stand in the way. \n\nThat hiring manager had 8 other resumes that day to review.

I can say my opinion of the recruiters who have reached out over the last several years is……..not great.  I don’t know if it’s the fault of companies making demands or if some recruiters just feel the need to make commission, but they lying, the insults, the manipulation of both the prospective employee and the employer to get a more convenient timeline for themselves and the entitled attitude really has soured my opinion of the profession.\n\nThe last recruiter who reached out lied about the approved salary range by an astounding $45k and sent me a fake info package that listed a completely in person position as fully remote.  After the second round of phone interviews, the hiring manager and I agreed on a date for an in person round to tour the lab facility (I was still unaware of the recruiter fudging the details).  The date was for 2 weeks later, or the first week of a new month.  Mr. Recruiter man wanted a yes or no answer on me taking the job by the end of the month so he lied to both parties saying the other side demanded the date be moved up two weeks to that same weekend.  It almost cost me the opportunity there and then, luckily it got resolved.  Both parties also found out about him fudging the details during that interview (which I had to be flown in for from out of state) and I did not take the offer that eventually came because of it.  He wasted a month and a half of everybody’s time and thousands of dollars.\n\nThese days I am a lot faster to shut a recruiter down if I smell a hint of bullshit but I would NEVER think to act with that level of entitlement.

{"id": "jxsgkfp", "text": "Sorry for the long post in advance:\n\nComing from a recruiter for a global tech sales team for a company that also receives hundreds of applicants in a weekend, salary is on par with market, recently started recruiting for our UK team these are my 2 cents:\n\nThis is not a recent trend but consistently seen quality of interviews and engagement decrease significantly since 2020\n\nRecruiting for entry level tech sales positions poses a challenge for your recruiting team because most of the requirements are not tangible: demeanor, engagement, attitude, humility, grit. Etc all of them slightly referenced in your post. All subjective and open to interpretation and biases. It could be that your recruiting team is not picking up these intangibles in the initial call and moving the wrong people forward. I would recommend taking a closer look at your questions and screening process so you can HELP your recruiting team get more context.\n\nI believe you might be biased because of your own sales profile and consider the bar to be for all people pursuing this position to be high but remember you are paying entry level ( btw, entry level market in UK is abysmal compared to North America, in these remote times candidates have many better options- I’m thinking that rude candidate had this in mind when he said you wasted his time, he is still a jerk but just some global context) so you will get entry level talent. It is your job as a hiring manager to decide whether or not the attributes and attitudes of a young sales professional are coachable or not and if you’re a leader that could help them GROW.\n\nLast thing, getting a high applicant volume means nothing now a days. You must focus on QUALITY. This does not mean your company is sought after or that you are competitive in the market. It means there’s plenty of people that I. Theory meet the minimum requirements for an entry level sales role, could be a car salesman, a recruiter, entrepreneur. Basically 90% of professionals with a degree and ability to dial up a phone. I truly advise looking inwards here. Refine your recruitment process so it serves you WHILE respecting people’s time. Your entitlement observations are coming from a place of privilege. People interviewing in this market are in desperate situations, might have to take a call course your kid is in daycare, might not have time off to decline client calls for an interview, etc. lots of times candidates match the energy of the interviewer if they are entitled, have you considered how you are coming across?  Remember respect is earned. Everyone has bad days especially in sales. Would this affect their performance if you coached them? It seems like an easy correction.\n\nI personally experience very few probably out of hundreds of interviews I can think of less than a handful rude interactions. I always keep my interviews, I am always on time. I do not in any circumstance reschedule an interview, I follow up even when there’s no updates. More than anything I am HONEST. My hiring managers are honest. Tech sales is a though job for not so great pay as it used to be. We must let them know it won’t be easy but we are actually committed to grow and training with a very specific grow path. Don’t waste people’s time. I always lead with our compensation and let them know we will not negotiate, if they are on the fence, I ask them to get back to me if they believe it’s worth their time.  Interviews are not tests. Let your recruiters prep their candidates so they are comfortable to perform at their best and shine in the interview. That’s the environment you should foster as a team and should be mimicked in a fair interview process.", "timestamp": "2023-08-26T04:23:31Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Speaking from a hiring manager side, I’ve noticed a lot of really unprofessional behaviour from candidates in interviews recently.

I can, however, agree with the job searching burnout.\n\nI've gotten dressed up for my interviews, both virtual and in person.

It didn't help.\n\nI've grown my network, both on LinkedIn and in my personal life. I've reached out to everyone I know, and also was the squeeky wheel to people in hiring positions. It didn't help.\n\nI've been told to keep learning, so I've been using whatever free time I have to learn more about the industry I've just gotten my undergrad from. It hasn't helped.\n\nI keep getting told I need to work on my interview skills. However, since I rarely get to that point, it's just advice that surves no purpose, so, doesn't help.\n\nI've been told that HR gets thousands of resumes, and there's too many to go through them all. But really, once a resume survives a trip through ATS, it should be read. That's HRs job in this scenario.\n\nAnd this is before we get into entry level 3 yoe posts, ghosting even though I was the one who was sought out, lying about WFH, posts in the wrong city, and the ever lovely \"Just put on a suit and pound the pavement\".\n\nThere is a lot of anger, frustration, desperation, and near homelessness on my side of the aisle. Not to excuse what you're going through, but we are struggling in every sense of the word. And, if we're to be honest, posts like this just reinforce those feelings. When I see stuff like this, it's usually after checking my emails and seeing that the job I applied to moved on, hired someone else, is no longer valid or, more often then not, gone zero contact.\n\nSo, yes. You're going to get some people who have given up to a degree, after months or years of seeing that no matter what they do, you're probably not going to hire them. \n\nFor every good HR or recruiter, there are 1,000 horror stories like I've listed above.\n\nAs for how to fix this, I really have no idea.
