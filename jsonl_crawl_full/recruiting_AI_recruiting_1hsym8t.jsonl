{"id": "m5euuw8", "text": "The requirements certainly overlap a lot. The reason I want to focus on agencies is that many of the in house focused ATS solutions include additional features, processes, or workflows in their pricing that aren't particularly useful for agencies.\n\nAdditionally, these solutions are less likely to accommodate agency-specific needs, which are often different from the needs of in-house teams. Therefore, their target audience is distinct.\n\nI've implemented in house focused ATS for many clients, and while they’re excellent tools for internal teams, they can be quite restrictive for external users.\n\nThat said, the work involved does share significant overlap.
