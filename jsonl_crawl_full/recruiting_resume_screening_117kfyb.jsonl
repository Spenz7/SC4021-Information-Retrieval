They tend to always follow a similar blueprint:\n\n1.) working at random companies in random locations that don’t make sense.  The companies are also typically super small.  They are also never currently employed.  They have always just left their last employer a few months prior.\n\n2.) I find that a lot of these fake profile are “based in Texas.”\n\n3.) a fully American name.  Typically real candidates that are Asian will either keep their real name or use an American first name and keep their given last name.  For example: Brian Li.  Brian Smith with a heavy Asian accent is usually a fake/scammer.\n\n4.). They tend to all have between 7-8 years of experience and the first sentence in their objective or intro usually says something like “full stack developer with 7 years of experience, etc”\n\n5.) usually they are FS or front end Javascript devs.  (React, Node, React Native).\n\n6.). Only want 100% remote no matter what.\n\n7.) sound like they’re in a call center.\n\n8.) always say that they are a US citizen (I think this is part of the scam).\n\n9.) heavy accent - though please don’t discriminate against everyone with an accent!
