{"id": "ky40wc0", "text": "In my experience in recruiting, hr tech, and consulting is that the majority of systems do not work the way that candidates think they do. You'll see a ton of posts about beating the ATS. When in reality what candidates are doing is using common language and keywords, which are more likely to be found through search functions as well as through recruiting resumes screens. \n\nI bring this up because most of the ATS/ERP systems I've worked with such as Workday, Taleo/oracle, Greenhouse, jazzhr, etc. Do not do a great job parsing resumes. They often split resumes up using anchor keywords. By that, I mean they find company names and grab the text in-between them. They use regular expression (regex) matching to do this with large amounts of data to pull from. A good example of this not working well is with names. Try putting clearance eligible in your demographic info on a workday/Salesforce application, and your name will show up as firat name clearance. Or if you include a lot of title names in your experience, it may split it up wrong.  This function does work well enough for most applications.\n\nI'm trying to simplify it all, but that's generally how it works. The reason I know this is I've been developing resume parsing techniques using AI (entity recognition, rag embedding, etc).

Then that same recruiter calls you again 2 weeks later for the same job, asking to send your CV for the same job she told you about 2 weeks earlier. Then ghost town and cricket sounds again. Then you decides to call the recruiter, since you didn't hear anything back (mind you for the same job in the space of 2 weeks), only to hear \"the role has been taken by someone more senior\" or \"manager is on holiday\" or \"the role has been put on hold\", etc. In my head, I'm like \"did you really send my CV or you just wanted to have my details in your database, did the job really exist or was it fake, or did you just want to test the market; are you a newbie who wanted to find connections, etc?\"\n\nThis is what frustrate candidates.

In theory, this is better for an applicant because it enables a recruiter to get beyond just their own knowledge set or biases to guide them on what a truly good match could be. On top of the skills matching, a good AI also looks at other data points, like job titles, career pathing, industry and company to see if what's on a person's resume \"makes sense.\" If you've got an applicant who is just throwing shit against the wall, the AI would be able to say \"hey, I know that other people who work for GEICO in these roles don't use these tools so let's flag that for further discussion.\"\n\nThat's the AI.\n\nThat all said, it's not a silver bullet.

{"id": "ldmykre", "text": "One important piece to consider here is the concept of 'structured' data vs 'non-structured' data.  A PDF (resume) with content is not really data, or at the very least would be considered 'unstructured data'.  Unstructured data is not really machine readable, which is why resumes need to be parsed, in order to convert the content into machine readable data, in order to support searching, filtering, and persistence of the information within the resume (as data).   The sh\\*tty thing is that most of this stuff starts off as 'structured data'.  So, you digitally put together a resume with 'data', and save it as a pdf (or doc).  Well, now you've made structured data into  unstructured data making it a lot less usable to non-humans (like recruiting/sourcing tools).   So, ATSs, Job boards, ERPs, will use someone like Daxtra, rChilli, Affinda, or textkernel to parse the pdf/doc unstructured data resumes and turn them into 'structured', machine-readable data so that the data can be used by tools for a more efficient recruiting/sourcing/hiring process.  \n\nThese resume parsers are getting better, sort of, but are still not perfect (or completely trustable). They are starting to use AI in the processing, where AI is actually really good with dealing with unstructured data and making sense of it....which should help with not punishing a candidate because their resume layout isn't very friendly with parsers.  Like, it used to be that if you put work experience under education or vice versa, this would 'trip up' the parser and thus the resume might not made it to the hiring manager.  The parsers are better at untangling this now and 'correctly' maps stuff to the right section header.  The other thing the parsers are doing is 'enriching' the data through the use of taxonomies.  Anyway, if you have ever used google translate to translate something from English to Cantonese and then translate the result in Cantonese back to English, you sometimes don't get exactly what you started with.   More and more information about potential employees (applicants, job seekers) is digital, and is structured data.  So, what would fix this is a \"digital, data-first\" resume that doesn't need to go through this ridiculous process that is not the most trustworthy.", "timestamp": "2024-07-17T17:05:26Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Does your ATS really parse through/filter resumes?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1bw5pmn/does_your_ats_really_parse_throughfilter_resumes/"}}

{"id": "m6dqiw4", "text": "Recruitment executive with 25 years of experience, managing thousands of hires annually here.\n\n\nYes, many ATS systems sort candidates based on relevance, and often, they don’t do it well. If your resume isn’t in the top 50, there’s a high chance it’ll never be seen by a human.\n\n\nTypically, if a recruiter reviews your resume and determines you're not a fit, they’ll hit “No,” triggering an automatic rejection email. Another common scenario is when the recruitment process is already advanced, often with internal candidates in consideration. In such cases, even if a job is posted today, external candidates might never be reviewed because an internal candidate is already favored, and the posting exists merely to meet meritocracy policies.\n\n\nEven when both internal and external candidates are considered, recruiters typically engage with 10-40 applicants (with exceptions of course). Once there’s a solid pipeline of 3-5 candidates reaching final interviews, no amount of real skill match will make recruiters review new resumes. Once an offer is accepted, recruiters usually close out the process, and all other candidates receive rejection emails-most without their resumes ever being opened by a human.\n\n\nThe process of offer negotiations, rejections, new offers, and falling back to the second-best candidate can take many weeks. During this time, the job may appear \"open,\" but in reality, no new candidates will be considered. Some companies even keep the job posted until the start date. Large companies close 15-30% of all jobs with employee referrals.\n\n\nExternal candidates usually lack key information about the true status of a vacancy. It’s quite possible that many of the roles you apply for are in a passive stage with semi-final candidates already in the mix. Therefore, the following strategy maximizes your chances as a candidate:\n1. Apply to as many positions as you can, but don't over-focus on customization-your effort may not be warranted.\n2. Ensure your most recent job is as relevant as possible to the advertised role. Ideally, aim for the same job title. Recruiters may disqualify you simply because your title doesn’t seem relevant enough. They rarely dig deeper than your last job before hitting \"No.\"\n3. Prioritize getting an internal referral or connecting directly with the hiring manager or someone higher up. Internal employees often receive referral bonuses, so even distantly connected employees are incentivized to refer you.
