{"id": "jcef77d", "text": "As an experienced agency recruiter, I get 1000s of resumes daily and I do have to utilize technology to make the process easier.   \nThe good part? I make minimum errors and find suitable candidates much more efficiently. All thanks to my ATS!   \nI have been using [Recruit CRM](https://recruitcrm.io/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit+syndication&amp;utm_campaign=organic+syndication&amp;utm_term=answer&amp;utm_content=011-homepage%2F) for a couple of years now, an easy-to-use ATS + CRM system that helps me parse resumes efficiently and convert them into PDFs for a detailed summary.   \nIt has a powerful Boolean + Filter search feature that looks for keywords in resume files.  \nI love its Chrome extension feature the most, which lets me source candidates directly from LinkedIn, Gmail, Outlook, Xing, and more! If you wish to check them out, you can visit their website and start a zero committment free trial or book a demo with one of their product specialists.", "timestamp": "2023-03-16T06:16:22Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "How common are the “algorithms” in the ATS we use?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/11okygd/how_common_are_the_algorithms_in_the_ats_we_use/"}}
{"id": "jpw2iqw", "text": "Our system uses an algorithm but how you can think about it easier is \"machine learning\". Basically what this does (at least our system) is gather information and data based on your company's previous hiring along with others. Our system then uses this data to improve the hiring process to make it more efficient, accurate, and optimal. For example, if you hire a customer service representative that didn't score greatly on the \"openness\" portion of the personality assessment, however, they are reported to be a great employee then the system will update and not count openness as important for that specific role. Another example is, if we see that during the application process, people quit the application during a specific question, we will see that friction point and take the question out or change it to optimate the process. That's why an ATS that utilizes customization and machine learning can be very beneficial during the hiring process.", "timestamp": "2023-06-28T18:33:20Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "How common are the “algorithms” in the ATS we use?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/11okygd/how_common_are_the_algorithms_in_the_ats_we_use/"}}
