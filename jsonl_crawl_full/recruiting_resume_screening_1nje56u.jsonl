{"id": "nfzic7n", "text": "**As a TalentMatched customer (and former skeptic), I'd like to offer a different perspective.**\n\nYour frustration is absolutely valid. Most first-generation AI recruitment tools were ChatGPT wrappers built by people who've never recruited. They missed the human elements that make recruitment work and often breach data protection laws.\n\nResearch shows 40% of talent specialists worry AI makes hiring impersonal - because, as most comments echo here, most tools try to replace human judgment rather than enhance it. Second-generation AI tools are built BY recruiters FOR recruiters. TalentMatched's founder has 23+ years of hands-on experience and understands your pain points.\n\n**What good AI DOESN'T do:**\n\n* Replace screening calls with avatars\n* Make hiring decisions for you\n* Generate generic summaries\n\n**What it DOES do:**\n\n* Instantly scores applications using contextual AI (not keywords)\n* Filters unqualified candidates automatically\n* Provides detailed summaries for qualified candidates\n* Integrates seamlessly with existing workflows\n\nI've cut screening time by 78% while having higher-quality conversations with better-qualified candidates.\n\nTo respond to some of the specific comments made:   \n\"AI can't cold call top talent\" - Correct, but it identifies who's worth calling faster  \n\"We didn't need CV screening help\" - Fair for simple roles, but 1,000+ applications overwhelm anyone  \n\"More steps, not fewer\" - Bad AI adds steps; good AI eliminates them\n\nLike Calendly revolutionized scheduling by removing friction (not replacing interaction), proper AI should enhance your expertise, not replace it.\n\n**My advice:** Be selective. Demand demos from actual recruiters, not salespeople. Insist on tools that augment rather than replace human judgment. The best recruiters win through relationships and market knowledge. The right AI just gives you superpowers to focus on what you do best.\n\n*Transparency: I'm a TalentMatched customer sharing what worked after trying multiple solutions.*", "timestamp": "2025-09-24T17:51:41Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "AI recruitment Companies are annoying.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1nje56u/ai_recruitment_companies_are_annoying/"}}
