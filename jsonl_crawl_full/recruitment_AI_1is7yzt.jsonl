{"id": "mdg0pyx", "text": "LinkedIn sales navigator is $79 a month (if you order it through the iPhone App Store. Or if you pay for it upfront for the year. For some reason, Apple made a deal with LinkedIn to let people who order it through the App Store. Pay the monthly price that people get for paying for the year.) \n\nI’ve done side-by-side searches with people who have full LinkedIn recruiter account. Our searches are within five or 10 people. They get like maybe five or 10 people more and you’re talking about 300, 400, 500 or more results. I’m pretty sure those five people aren’t worth the extra 800 bucks a month.\n\nThere are some downsides. It you are really big into  using open to work you can’t search that way on LinkedIn sales navigator. \n\nIf you send emails as part of your recruitment process, they go to “other“ when you send them through sales navigator   (Not all the time, but a lot of the time) \n\nThis is what I’ve been doing as has worked very well. I use LinkedIn sales navigator for sourcing. Their search parameters are very good and as I said, similar results as LinkedIn recruiter. I then send LinkedIn connection request instead of emails if I want to get a hold of someone. Granted I can’t leave them this long, detailed message, I don’t do that anyway, but House New York’s family network and once you become a first reconnection, you can often get their contact info.\n\nI use salesQL to find contact info and it will scrape 25 profiles at a time off LinkedIn sales navigator and enrich them for you. 1000 credits are 40 bucks a month   \n\nSo you can check out something like chatterworks, ($50 a month 1000 contact credits ) which will give you access to pretty much all the LinkedIn profiles on LinkedIn but I still think it’s worth paying $79 a month so you never get stuck in LinkedIn jail for using chrome extensions and LinkedIn automation tools and stuff like that. It’s not scientifically proven, but I truly believe that paying the $79 makes LinkedIn see you as a lower priority for using stuff that’s supposed to be “banned“ on their website.", "timestamp": "2025-02-18T15:44:47Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Any new platforms that can replace LinkedIn?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1is7yzt/any_new_platforms_that_can_replace_linkedin/"}}
