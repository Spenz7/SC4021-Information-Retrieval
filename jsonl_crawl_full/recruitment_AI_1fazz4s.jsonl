{"id": "m9pbned", "text": "After helping hundreds of people start their own recruiting businesses, here's my practical take on essential tools while keeping costs manageable:\n\nFor Candidate Sourcing:\n\n* LinkedIn Recruiter Lite is solid, but don't overlook Google as a powerful (and free) sourcing tool. Here's a quick hack: Use search strings like \"filetype:XLS technical account manager directory attendee\" to find spreadsheets from tech conferences with candidate contact info. This often surfaces passive candidates you won't find on LinkedIn.\n* Boolean strings on Google can also help you find resumes hosted on personal websites and Github profiles\n\nFor ATS:\n\n* Start with Zoho Recruit ($30/month) or Freshteam's free tier\n* Many solo recruiters I know actually start with a well-organized Google Drive system + spreadsheet. It's not fancy but it works until you scale\n\nFor Contact Finding:\n\n* Apollo.io is a solid alternative to ZoomInfo. Their free tier gives you 20 credits/month\n* Hunter.io + Chrome extension for email finding (free tier available)\n* Clearbit Connect (Gmail extension) gives you 100 free email lookups monthly\n\nFor Email Marketing:\n\n* SendGrid's free tier (100 emails/day)\n* Sendinblue has better pricing than Mailchimp for small volumes\n\nOne important note: Focus your budget on LinkedIn first. I see too many new recruiters trying to use every tool under the sun. In reality, you can start making placements with just:\n\n* LinkedIn Recruiter Lite\n* Basic Google Workspace\n* A simple CRM/spreadsheet system\n\nOnce you make your first placement (typically $20-30k fee), then you can reinvest in more sophisticated tools.", "timestamp": "2025-01-28T20:52:19Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Seeking recommendations for essential tools and software for a one person recruitment firm.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1fazz4s/seeking_recommendations_for_essential_tools_and/"}}
