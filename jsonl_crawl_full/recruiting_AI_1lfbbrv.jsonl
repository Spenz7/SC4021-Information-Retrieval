It is free, quick to set up, and you can invite as many team members as you like.\n\nYou can post unlimited jobs, track applicants in one place, and keep your hiring process organised. It supports multiple users and roles, lets you add pre screening questions to filter out irrelevant candidates, and allows you to build custom assessment and evaluation flows so you always know where each applicant is in the process, from first interview to reference check and beyond.\n\nIt only takes a few minutes to create a free account and get started – no complicated setup needed.\n\nWe made the software completely free because in a world where almost everything has a price tag or subscription, we thought it made sense to offer real value without charging. We built it for our own portfolio companies and then made it public because it was too useful to keep private. Since it costs very little for us to maintain, monetising it is not a focus. Maybe one day, if hundreds of thousands of users join, we will add a paid plan, but for now it is free and staying that way.\n\nMany organisations now use it to streamline their hiring.
