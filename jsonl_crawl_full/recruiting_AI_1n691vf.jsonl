{"id": "nbzthy4", "text": "I think a lot of the “dead end” talk comes from the transactional side of recruiting being easier to automate. Job postings, scheduling, even initial screens are already handled more efficiently with AI tools. But that’s not the whole job.\n\nRecruiting is also stakeholder management, influencing hiring managers, guiding candidates through uncertain career decisions, and aligning people strategy with business goals. Those parts are messy, human, and strategic. I don’t see AI replacing that anytime soon. If anything, automation frees us up to focus more on that higher-value work.\n\nAs for growth: it depends on how you play it. Some recruiters move into HRBP, TA leadership, people ops, or even sales/consulting roles because the skills overlap. Others stay in TA but specialize (exec search, employer branding, workforce planning, etc.). I think the career has plenty of runway if you keep building skills beyond just sourcing and scheduling.\n\nPersonally, I do enjoy recruiting, it’s stressful sometimes, but there’s something rewarding about connecting the right person to the right role and seeing the impact. The industry might shrink, but it’s not going away.

I enjoy it even more now that I'm with a company with great T.A. leadership and I'm not overwhelmed. \n\nHowever at my current company, no there's no career growth. I have no desire to move into management. The only person I want to manage is myself, lol.  I have one step up that will be a promotion in pay that is nonmanagerial but the budget hasn't been in aligned for growth in our department lately. \n\nAlso, been considering Career Coaching as I've been doing this informally forever but why not get paid for it.", "timestamp": "2025-09-02T16:16:29Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Is Recruitment Truly a Dead End Career?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1n691vf/is_recruitment_truly_a_dead_end_career/"}}

{"id": "nd3fdrj", "text": "I don’t think it’s dead.  I have a ton of activity from both client and candidates.  I think a lot of it is finding a niche and excelling in it.  Yes some of it’s being replaced but there is a certain level of recruiting that AI can’t work.  Its sales.  It’s people.

{"id": "ndaer8l", "text": "Recruitment isn’t a dead end, but it is evolving fast. AI can handle sourcing, screening, and even initial outreach better than ever, but the real value of recruiters has always been in the human side: stakeholder management, negotiation, understanding fit beyond a CV, and building trust with both candidates and hiring managers.\n\nFor me, the path forward looks less like “filling roles” and more like talent strategy, advising companies on employer branding, candidate experience, and long-term workforce planning. Those parts aren’t going away anytime soon.\n\nIf you enjoy the people side of recruiting, there’s still plenty of growth. The recruiters who thrive will be the ones who lean into strategy and relationships, while letting AI do the repetitive work in the background.", "timestamp": "2025-09-09T16:23:48Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Is Recruitment Truly a Dead End Career?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1n691vf/is_recruitment_truly_a_dead_end_career/"}}
{"id": "ne7jmed", "text": "I have been recruiting for 7 years and prior to that was in sales. I'm at a mid-size agency do plan on staying a recruiter, as I don't have a long timeline ahead of me (probably 7-8 more years of FT work)- so won't be launching a new career now.  I don't see recruiting as dying and I do see that AI is helping us a lot (with research, note takers etc).  I am on the GTM side, mostly higher-end tech sales roles, so it's not just a matter of checklists for these folks or skills assessments. It's helping customers with the search strategies (as someone else mentioned too), then deep qualification to vet out they truly have the skills, that they show up in a professional way, are motivated, etc.  It would be hard to ask an AI to do all I do right now I think.   I do think it's really important to be deeply entrenched in your niche- I think- and I hope that being an expert in my field will give me enough years till I can retire!", "timestamp": "2025-09-14T18:18:17Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Is Recruitment Truly a Dead End Career?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1n691vf/is_recruitment_truly_a_dead_end_career/"}}
