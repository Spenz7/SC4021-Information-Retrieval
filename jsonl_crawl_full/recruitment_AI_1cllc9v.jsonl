{"id": "lg4stmq", "text": "Yeah, AI for resume screening is getting pretty popular, especially when you're drowning in hundreds of resumes.I know how much it can save screening time because I work as an internal recruiter. Our process was a little disorganized when we initially started using it, but it soon became lot more efficient. It helped us focus on candidates who actually fit what we were looking for, which sped things up nicely.  \n  \nBut it's not just about speed - accuracy can be hit or miss depending on the tool. We had to keep tweaking our AI to make sure it wasn't overlooking good candidates. At first, it was tossing out resumes with unusual experience, even if they had the right skills. We fixed that with some adjustments.  \n  \nIf you're thinking about using AI, start small. We tried it out on a few roles first, got feedback, and made changes as we went. One big lesson: AI is great, but you still need that human touch. We always had someone review the AI-picked resumes to catch things the AI might miss.  \n  \nBottom line: AI can really help with resume screening and hiring faster, but keep an eye on how it's doing and adjust as needed. And definitely keep that human element in the final stages - it's key to not missing out on great candidates who might not fit the AI's exact criteria.
