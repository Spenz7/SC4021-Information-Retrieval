I haven't built one for recruitment though, but I once had a client considering building one so I did a little bit of thinking and research around that. A keyword-only screening and ranking tool is limited. A robust AI model will give weights to keywords, soft skills, transferable skills, years of experience, and much more. So, I would say it depends on what the company wants for the role. They determine what they value the most, and a company that values years of experience and transferable skills will put higher weights on that over just matching keywords.

{"id": "nie54f7", "text": "I totally agree with this. A lot of systems today are quietly rejecting strong candidates just because they don’t “overmatch” a job description.\n\nMost of these tools rely heavily on keyword or contextual matching , they scan for exact phrasing from the job post. The issue is, candidates already know this. They’re tailoring their resumes with AI tools to match the JD perfectly, sometimes even exaggerating experience. So they float to the top, while genuinely capable people with transferable skills or slightly different wording get buried.\n\nI’ve seen it happen with simple things like “3 years experience required” ,someone with 2.5 years of amazing, relevant experience never even makes it through the filter. These systems are too rigid, and they miss the nuance of growth potential or adaptability.\n\nWhat’s worse is that some recruiters are being sold tools that claim to be “AI” but are just running keyword logic or even using bots to interview  or test candidates. That only creates bias and kills candidate experience. You end up with AI judging AI  and the human element gets lost.\n\nHonestly, the best approach is balance. Use AI for efficiency, not judgment. Screen for qualities that algorithms can’t see: attention to detail, curiosity, problem-solving, teamwork, accountability, and genuine communication. These are the things that actually determine success on the job.\n\nBecause yes, AI can help you avoid bad hires , but it can also silently eliminate the best ones if you let it run unchecked.", "timestamp": "2025-10-08T09:07:06Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Are we just rejecting great candidates because they didn't use the 'right' keywords?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1o01gie/are_we_just_rejecting_great_candidates_because/"}}
