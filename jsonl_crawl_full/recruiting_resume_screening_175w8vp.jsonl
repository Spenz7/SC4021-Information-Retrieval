{"id": "k4j34ct", "text": "Greenhouse’s ecosystem of 3P product integrations is a big draw. A company needs to be able to build a hiring process and a recruiting stack that meets their unique needs. There’s zero appeal in a prepackaged “end-to-end” tool with no optionality, such as the one you are proposing. \n\nAlso I think you’re a little blurry on where a job board ends and an ATS begins. Indeed isn’t an ATS. A legit company wouldn’t replace a fully-functional ATS with a shitty job board, so I’m not sure what you think you’re solving for there. Greenhouse already gives users the option to integrate with Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Otta, Remotive, and like 20+ other job boards. I wonder if you know why a Greenhouse user would choose to directly integrate with any of those boards. \n\nRespectfully, it’s clear that you’re an engineer solving the problems you’ve decided are important. A non-spammy, reliable, high-quality job board aggregator with a clean interface and ATS integration capability would be a lot more compelling than anything you’ve described in steps 2 or 3.", "timestamp": "2023-10-12T06:38:40Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "If LinkedIn &amp; Greenhouse had a baby....", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/175w8vp/if_linkedin_greenhouse_had_a_baby/"}}

{"id": "k4nfcvi", "text": "This idea is appealing to candidates - fewer applications and more opportunities, right? But a database like this would be a hard sell to recruiters who have zero desire to sort through even more mediocre applications. Companies pay to use Greenhouse, not candidates, so they'd need to figure out how to make this something an employer would pay for on top of what they already pay for the core ATS.\n\nRecruiters want quality not volume. I've worked for a couple of highly-desirable tech companies in a people operations role for the past 5 years; typically no more than 15% of all hires come from inbound applications and generally regarded as a low-quality source.\n\nSo unless this database comes equipped with a first-of-its-kind best-in-class AI talent match feature, there's no clear value proposition. Automatic consideration is not feasible. Greenhouse would need to build (or license) an exceptionally accurate native AI screening/sorting/ranking tool into this database to manage that kind of inbound volume.\n\nPlus there's no existing connective tissue between companies using Greenhouse, so they'd have to invest in building a backend data structure to support an independent database.\n\nAnd if Greenhouse were to build such a database, they'd be held to compliance regulations, employment laws, as well as data privacy laws that come along with collecting and storing candidate information. I doubt they are eager to take on that kind of risk.\n\nSo tl;dr - what's stopping greenhouse is probably that they can't make money on something like that", "timestamp": "2023-10-13T02:05:14Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "If LinkedIn &amp; Greenhouse had a baby....", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/175w8vp/if_linkedin_greenhouse_had_a_baby/"}}
