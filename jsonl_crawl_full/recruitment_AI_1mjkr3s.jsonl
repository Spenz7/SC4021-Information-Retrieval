The time savings are real but you gotta set it up properly or it becomes a nightmare... learned that the hard way when our first attempt filtered out basically everyone lol.

I used the trial of Loxo and was pretty impressed, considering switching to that. I am a believer that process refinement of this nature starts at the CRM level but we all know how these contracts work :/\n\nAs for sourcing I've ditched Recruiter for sales nav and have a semi-automated approach to outreaching. I'll share a guide with you this evening when I get some free time. I am currently working on 12 high-level roles and have managed to save a lot of time with a handful of \"AI powered tools\" - I use the term AI loosely here because most of these tools don't actually use leverage machine learning. (ai has become a bit of a buzz word imo).\n\nfor some context, I have made 4 \"cold calls\" this entire week (on the client side... dont get me started on the candidates) and won 3 $15k+ contracts. Obviously these wont all close, however it has saved me time to catch up on a lot of admin work this week specifically. When i say 4 calls i truly mean that i dialed and pressed the green button 4 times total. only one of those individuals answered the call, the other two called me back the following day. When I was working at my first firm, I likely wouldve had to make 150 calls for a similar result (all to people I have spoken with in the past)\n\nI am paying about $500 US for everything i use at the moment (not counting my CRM) and surprisingly the tools that i use for business development can be creatively leveraged for sourcing as well.\n\nwhen i first went off on my own as a recruiter i became obsessed with automating a lot of processes and wasted tons of time over complicating that. I dont use workflows like n8n, make, or Zapier although i am sure they would help a lot of people. I essentially just leveraged tools to make everything I was already doing (the fundamentals) about 10x more efficient and I dont have any more \"no luck\" days.

{"id": "n7wk4ax", "text": "Most of the AI tools. For HR are very clumsy.. Poorly planned and thought out.\nThe scoring is random and opaque which ends up in legal issues like Workday vs Mobley. This raises the question of legality. There are at least 81 legal statutes controlling the use of AI in HR or recruitment. You need to comply with the ones in your jurisdiction... and the penalties are heavy. NYC upto $1500 per transaction, and the EU can be over €30M.\nThe key aspects are:\n1) Transparency: \nThe algorithm must be transparent, and documented\nThe decision must be explained, and transparent.\n2) Candidate rights\nYou must inform the candidate of their data privacy rights.\nMost jurisdiction require you to give the right to withdraw\nMany jurisdictions demand that you give the candidate the right to update and elect to have a manual review.\n3) Auditability\nEvery decision must be documented. Not just what the decision was, but how it was made.\n4) Bias\nIn general it is not permissible to let AI select candidates by any protected characteristic in you jurisdiction. Usually sex and race are the minimum.\nBias neutrality in many jurisdictions must be regularly tested and results published.\n5) Human intervention: Many jurisdictions are not permitting entirely machine made decisions. This is also good practice if you know AI and are a recruiter. The AI can do the heavy lifting - but you can pick up nuances which are not obvious to a machine.\n\nThis is not meant to be a definitive list, or legal advice, but a quick insight into the minefield of recruitment AI. It is a 'high risk category' for most.\n\nThe laws governing this are being implemented right now. NYC and California are in place, the EU AI Act comes in early next year. By this time next year AI in recruitment and TA will be a very different landscape.\n\nIf you want to get ahead of the curve read this article:\nhttps://www.talentmatched.com/the-great-ai-hiring-circus/\n\nI am partisan, so I will not comment on other vendors, but there are some great tools like Talentmatched which will produce reliable results at a reasonable cost..
