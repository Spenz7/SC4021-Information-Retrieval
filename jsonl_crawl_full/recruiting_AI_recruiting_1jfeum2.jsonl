{"id": "mj1c9km", "text": "AI’s been a huge unlock across the recruiting flow with many people I work with. I’ve seen folks use it effectively for everything from sourcing and outreach to note-taking, scheduling, and even initial screening.\n\nFor sourcing, tools like Hireflow or Lazy apply AI to find and prioritize top-of-funnel candidates. For outreach, ChatGPT helps write more tailored emails that actually get responses, especially when paired with enrichment tools like Clay or Apollo.\n\nNote-taking is another low-hanging fruit: Fireflies or [Otter.ai](http://Otter.ai) are great for automatically summarizing calls and syncing notes to your ATS.\n\nThere are also newer tools now that take it a step further &amp; do most things with AI. [Promap](https://www.promap.ai), for example, sources (searches LinkedIn &amp; other places for best fit candidates and gives you a list), filters inbound resumes and runs voice-based interviews to assess candidates, then generates a ranked shortlist. It’s especially helpful for startups or lean teams that don’t have time to manually screen dozens of candidates or interview for roles they’re not deeply familiar with.\n\nMore mainstream ATS' like Ashby &amp; Greenhouse are also not using AI to do resume filtering. It really depends on where you want to get efficiency gains.", "timestamp": "2025-03-21T20:32:25Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Recruiters and AI", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1jfeum2/recruiters_and_ai/"}}
{"id": "miqn7z0", "text": "I would die without it. I post a lot on LinkedIn about hot jobs and I post mpcs. Claude writes all of that. I send targeted mass emails every day showcasing mpcs. Claude uses the resume to write the mpc. Claude writes the opening paragraph and the closing sentence. A lotn of my clients have weird ways of writing, and Claude tells me what they're are trying to convey and then he writes a response for me. I put evyer single email through Claude, I'm a very dry writer and he perks things up for me and ensures I'm using good grammar. I put job descriptions in Claude and tell him to give me questions to ask the hiring manager to find out stuff not on the job description. Then he takes the job description and writes questions for me to ask candidates. I upload a resume and the job description I'm matching it to, add in my notes from my call with the candidate, and Claude creates an amazing candidate submittal to send to my client with the resume. Today I put five payroll resumes in Claude, and he created five really good mpcs, then he drafted a greeting and email subject line that I loaded up with the mpcs to send to all my payroll buyers. I'm sure I'm leaving stuff off.
