Yeah, AI will absolutely remove that part of the job. \n\nBut finding candidates who are qualified and convincing them to come work for your company are two completely different things.  That is the actual “recruit” part of recruiting. That particular portion will be much more in demand because very few people are focusing on it now because they’re so busy just trying to find candidates that fit.\n\nThis has been a pattern, slow slowly developing over the last 20 years. It started with x-ray scans and boolian searches, etc.   \n\n“ recruiters”, and I use that term very loosely, have been focused on learning how to use the tools, instead of learning, how to actually be a recruiter.  Suddenly, people could identify talent, much faster….. but could t hire them.\n\nPerspective (and I’ve done studies on this for my company) in the early 2000s we were getting hires on approximately 10% of tallent identified.  Now, less than 1%.  Same number of hires (approximately).  The only excuse for that possible is that there is lack of skill in recruiting talent….but we sure can find them now lol.\n\nNow, those same people are in leadership roles, and they themselves don’t know how to recruit.  So they can’t train people either.\n\nMy guess: people that actually know how to recruit will be very high in demand and make a shit ton of money.
