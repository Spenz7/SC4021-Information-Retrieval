{"id": "n6e55k5", "text": "If you take those key word skills that are being listed in a giant heap at the top of the resume and instead, weave them into bullet points that are placed under your various roles, it makes for a much stronger impact than just listing them out, while simultaneously still ensuring they are included in the resume if you’re concerned about matching the skills posted in the opening.\n\nThis is how I have candidates re-work their resumes when they are just out of hand and are interested in roles that our firm is representing. This is the best way to do it. But if you really don’t want to or see the benefit, then I still suggest doing it with, let’s say half, and then if you really feel you need a big clump of “skills” listed out because you’re concerned whatever program is being used to scan resumes won’t otherwise select your resume, then put that huge brick of skills at the very back/bottom of your resume. That way, if you’re not willing/able to weave them into the bullets describing your experience under your various roles, they are still there for the computer program to pick up. But from an actual hiring manager perspective, they’re interested in reading about and learning about what you ACTUALLY DID. And how it relates to their opening/need. They are NOT personally once they review a resume, scanning some huge “skills” section, to make sure a particular word is listed. Yes, maybe internally if that word appears no where in the resume, maybe it doesn’t make it to their desk? I don’t know for sure but weaving it into the resume takes care of that problem either way and once it makes it to a live person, they’re reviewing for your experience. \n\nIf there are a lot of “skills” you find to appear similarly in the roles you’re applying for, make a separate document of bullets that contain those key skill words that you can have at hand to plug and play into your resume, if you’re concerned about trying to make a master resume that incorporates all of them including skills that don’t seem required for a role here or there.", "timestamp": "2025-08-01T18:13:31Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "For those of us still manually screening resumes — what are your quietest pet peeves?

I see what AI search functions come up with for candidates on on job sites and LinkedIn, and to say I am underwhelmed is really under expressing how underwhelmed I really am. Plus, I’m so fast at reading resumes that AI really doesn’t save me any time. The thing that takes the longest is simply having the resume load. So I tend to open about 10 at once and then screen them rapidly.\n\nI always save resumes with a standard format that I have developed so that I know when I got them and who’s they are.\n\nTotally agree with your hate of over-complicated formats. My personal hate is text boxes that mean you can’t copy information from the résumé into a form when you’re doing interviews.\n\nETA – another one – resumes without contact information. Out of the contact information is just as bad, but no contact information is just perplexing. The whole point of a résumé is to be contacted!", "timestamp": "2025-07-25T05:23:15Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "For those of us still manually screening resumes — what are your quietest pet peeves?

{"id": "n5sip2y", "text": "I mean I get the logic. Nobody likes a job hopper. But to call it a pet peeve is sad. You’re annoyed that somebody is wasting your time for trying to get on track. Layoffs have been super prevalent in past 4 years. So do specialists just give up their career and go work retail forever? Since they’ll never get a second look if their resume goes through you. You’re passing up otherwise good candidates for sure.\n\nIt’s the same for grammar/formatting mistakes. Some candidates may be otherwise qualified but have a shitty resume and are immediately written off. But at least I understand that because it shows carelessness or lack of awareness. But just blindly recognizing a pattern that may be totally justifiable is ignorant. \n\nSo not trying to rant too long but honest question: if you are laid off twice in 3 years. Should you put that in your resume with the job experience? Seems weird to advertise but maybe it’s better to include it than to have someone assume you’re just quitting/getting fired?", "timestamp": "2025-07-29T13:43:34Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "For those of us still manually screening resumes — what are your quietest pet peeves?
