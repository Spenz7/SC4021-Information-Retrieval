{"id": "mwf9pc3", "text": "This is a really tricky problem and honestly something we're thinking about a lot at Promap too. The AI cheating tools are getting pretty sophisticated.\n\nFew things that have worked for our clients:\n\n1. Live collaborative coding - Instead of just coding challenges, have them walk through their solution step by step while they're building it. Ask them to explain their thought process in real time. The AI tools struggle when candidates have to articulate WHY they made certain decisions.\n2. Follow-up questions on their own code - If they submit a coding challenge beforehand, spend most of the interview asking them to modify or extend their solution. \"What would happen if we needed to handle 10x more data?\" etc. Real engineers can adapt their own code, but candidates using AI tools usually can't.\n3. System design with constraints - Give them a system design problem but then throw in weird constraints halfway through. \"Actually, now assume we can only use 50MB of memory\" - watch how they pivot.\n4. Code review exercises - Show them intentionally buggy code and ask them to spot issues. Way harder for AI tools to help with since its more about experience and intuition.\n\nThe key is making the interview conversational and unpredictable. The AI tools work best when candidates can predict what's coming next.\n\nWhat type of roles are you hiring for?

{"id": "nny179o", "text": "Dealing with cheating in remote interviews is definitely tricky, but there are several strategies to minimize it. First, make sure to use real-time, interactive technical assessments rather than take-home assignments, as it’s harder for candidates to use AI tools in a live coding environment. Platforms like HackerRank, Codility, and CodeSignal offer real-time coding challenges where you can also observe the candidate’s problem-solving process. If you’re concerned about cheating, ask candidates to verbally walk you through their approach to solving problems during the interview. Carv can help streamline the logistics, like scheduling and follow-ups, while giving you time to dig deeper into a candidate’s abilities.
