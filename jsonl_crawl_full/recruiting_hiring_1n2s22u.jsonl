{"id": "nbcq1a2", "text": "both things can be true --\n\n1) someone seeking a VP role who spent the time to give you a head's up, could have stopped at any mall or even a Target or WalMart to get a pair of khakis. To some extent, at that job role, you really should be more aware.\n\n2) at the same time, they let you know, basically asking, and no one told them it would not be acceptable, so it is what it is. Dinging them is a bit odd given the advance notice. Plenty of businesses are ok with casual, so perhaps he didn't know?\n\nIn general, the best advice is to set expectations for candidates and share the dress code - especially as you say, this was not last minute.", "timestamp": "2025-08-29T17:38:01Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "VP Candidate Wants to Wear Jeans to Interview: Update", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1n2s22u/vp_candidate_wants_to_wear_jeans_to_interview/"}}
