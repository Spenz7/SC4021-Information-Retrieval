{"id": "l879awu", "text": "I mean to say LLMs are bad because they can’t do math is kinda hard. The reality is LLMs do have tons of practical applications, the problem is everyone tries to make things with them - plus every manager believes that the $0.001 / token is too expensive to pay Microsoft or equivalent, so they hire cheap workers to make a cheap knockoff that sucks and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars (to millions) and could have sent requests for a decade with that cost. LLMs are very good at digesting resumes, summarizing experiences - let’s be honest, no recruiter knows every industry more than an LLM (of course they might be better than any LLM in a single industry, but across the board? No way) \n\nAdditionally, LLMs get much stronger with better prompting (although we are already seeing strides with weak prompts - like yours, your prompt is the weakest most difficult ambiguous prompt for an LLM) \n\nI did a nearly identical request to an LLM and got a perfectly explained whole answer (that’s correct) in 1 second. \n\nLLMs are as good as the user. They will be integral to our day-to-day forever now. Operating and using an LLM is, in my opinion, as necessary as being able to say “I am proficient in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint”\n\n\nFrom free GPT call -&gt; \n\n“””\nTo calculate the hourly wage required for an annual salary of $150,000, you can use the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Hourly Wage} = \\frac{\\text{Annual Salary}}{\\text{Total Hours Worked per Year}} \\]\n\nAssuming a standard full-time schedule of 40 hours per week and 52 weeks per year, the calculation would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Hours Worked per Year} = 40 \\times 52 = 2080 \\]\n\nSo, the hourly wage is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Hourly Wage} = \\frac{150,000}{2080} \\approx 72.12 \\]\n\nTherefore, an employee needs to earn approximately $72.12 per hour to have an annual salary of $150,000 before taxes.\n“””", "timestamp": "2024-06-12T00:42:27Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Reason #671 AI is trash in our industry", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1ddjgwm/reason_671_ai_is_trash_in_our_industry/"}}
