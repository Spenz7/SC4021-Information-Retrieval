{"id": "np3og32", "text": "As a final-year F-1 student in a STEM program who is actively applying for jobs, I think a big part of the confusion comes from how “sponsorship” is interpreted. For STEM students, employers don’t sponsor OPT or the 24-month STEM extension. The student applies on their own, the school issues the I-20, USCIS approves it, and the employer doesn’t file anything beyond the normal I-9. From the student’s point of view, that feels like “no sponsorship,” because they can work up to three years with zero employer paperwork.\n\nBut when employers say “sponsorship,” they usually mean H-1B or any kind of long-term immigration filing. Most students don’t realize that distinction, and advisors often phrase it poorly, which is why candidates think checking “No” is the correct/accurate answer. I agree that intentionally lying is a bad idea, but a lot of international students are honestly confused about what the question is actually asking.\n\nI totally understand why companies with ITAR, DoD, or other government-contractor restrictions can’t hire visa holders. That’s just the nature of those roles. At the same time, outside of those regulated positions, giving a student a chance on OPT isn’t the same as taking on sponsorship and many of us are just trying to find a place to start our careers without creating extra burden for an employer.", "timestamp": "2025-11-16T05:30:38Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Do you now or will you require future visa sponsorship?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1ljqky6/do_you_now_or_will_you_require_future_visa/"}}
