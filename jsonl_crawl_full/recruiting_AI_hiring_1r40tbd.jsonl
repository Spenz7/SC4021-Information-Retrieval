{"id": "o5fy6kn", "text": "100% a screening issue that is easy to overcome. Ask people how things work, get into the gritty details. People are going to use AI just like they are going to use BS Code or vi or vim or whatever IDE. You can spot the people who are lazy, don't care, not that good and easily separate them from passionate and mission compatible developers long before they get to a hiring team interview. if your recruiter can't do that, DM me and I'll be happy to share some methods for training your recruiter or how to find a better one. Free tip: don't post your job to places like Indeed.com, go find the people you want to talk to. The people who respond to indeed are not those people.", "timestamp": "2026-02-15T02:18:35Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Hiring manager accusing candidate of using AI on resume and interview", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1r40tbd/hiring_manager_accusing_candidate_of_using_ai_on/"}}
