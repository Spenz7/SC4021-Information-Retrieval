How did you handle the situation? Where did you get the information you needed?

They also may have found an entirely different stakeholder to be part of the project. \n\nThe one you don’t want is the one who says they explained to them how important their involvement was or why the deadlines were important and it magically changed or that they escalated to one of their managers to get what they needed without trying anything else. \n\nWhat you are looking for is creativity along with that hustle and drive. \n\nAnother good indicator is to find out how your candidates felt when their manager has left the organization. Is it oh no, more work for us with more ambiguity? Or is it no problem, I’ll step in to fill in while they are gone, it’s an opportunity to learn more and take on more. \n\nLastly, I set the stage about being solution oriented during the interview process. I tell my team that I don’t have a lot of time for them and that our 1:1s, which are scheduled weekly, will often get bumped due to other meetings. That means they are doing to need to use that time wisely. But that when they do have an issue I’m always here to work through it, but I expect that they’ve already worked through a few possible solutions and are coming to me for guidance on them, not asking me to solve the problem for them.  \n\nThis has created teams that have that exact mentality you are looking for, and the best part is that when a new hire comes in, the rest of the team is very supportive of helping them understand how to be solution oriented in that way. I will say that sometimes a new hire will come to me without a couple ideas, and I will cut our time short and send them back to the team to better prepare. The first time that happens can have the new hire in panic mode but the team usually sorts them out and will bring them back to me when they are ready. \n\nWhat we end up getting are folks who collaborate really well on solving problems together, who understand how to gain leadership support for their ideas, and are empowered to own those solutions either in full or in part even as relatively new members of the organization.

What did you create and why?\"  \n\\- \"Give me an example of when you disagreed with your manager's approach but had to move forward anyway\"  \n  \nThe key is in the follow-ups. Keep asking \"what did you do next?\" and \"how did you decide that?\" - people who truly own things will have detailed answers about their decision-making process.  \n  \nRed flags I watch for:  \n\\- Vague answers about team contributions (can't specify their individual role)  \n\\- Always mentioning their manager when describing accomplishments    \n\\- Using \"we\" constantly without being able to break down personal contributions  \n  \nOne thing that's worked really well: Give them a real problem your company is facing right now (nothing confidential obviously) and ask them to walk through how they'd approach it.
