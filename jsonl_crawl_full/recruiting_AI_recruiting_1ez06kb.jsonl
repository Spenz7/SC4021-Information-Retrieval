{"id": "ljhbcmf", "text": "I was fortunate enough to test out LinkedIn’s new AI search and…….. it is awful. I am an avid LinkedIn user and a huge fan of their normal search algorithm, but the AI feature essentially is a way worse version of using regular Boolean with their normal search engine. I understand the need to not fall behind with trending technology, but I was really surprised by what they rolled out as I don’t see why you would rely on this unless you just have zero knowledge of Boolean. The results the AI search gave me were all over the place and mostly irrelevant to my search. The AI will essentially consume what you are telling it and create a search based on what it thinks you want… no matter how concise I got or how much information I fed it, it just wasn’t giving me candidates that I wanted to see.\n\nIf anything, the experience gave me hope about the long term survival of recruiters because it did such a poor job of producing qualified talent.", "timestamp": "2024-08-23T02:01:09Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "AI is overhyped ?
