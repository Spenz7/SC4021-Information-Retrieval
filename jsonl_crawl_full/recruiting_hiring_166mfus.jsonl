He took 3 months off to find himself and do some things that he always wanted to do but just didn't have time before. Then admitted that trying to find a new job ended up being harder than he thought when he started looking again. He talked about his struggles with getting interviews and said a lot of things we see like he would just get ghosted with no follow up.  And he talked about what he did differently to try to get noticed like contacting hiring managers on linkedin, revamped his resume, worked his network, etc.  \n\nThis could have been 100% bullshit but it sounded sincere.

Unfortunately, not everyone is good at understanding what it’s like to be in a candidate’s shoes, even though they were once there themselves in their professional career. I’m sorry your experiences have been largely negative. \n\nI do want to note that “I’m not legally permitted to discuss my separation at this time” isn’t the same thing as saying you signed an NDA that prohibits you from sharing the name of your employer. (What I put in quotations is what I would recommend saying, to answer your question.) There could be a myriad of reasons that prohibit an employee from discussing separation. \n\nAn NDA is a legal contract that is not restrictive in the way of stating with whom you were employed. It often refers to relationships within the business itself. For example, my past NDAs have prevented me from sharing client relationships with recruited candidates. This was due to market agreements that separate companies had agreed upon. \n\nThe point of this post is that most recruiters will know you’re being untruthful by saying this because such restrictions are incredibly rare (I don’t want to say it **never** happens, because I’m sure someone has done this in the past, but not in anything the average person would know).
