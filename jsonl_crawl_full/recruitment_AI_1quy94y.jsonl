{"id": "o5gqfvj", "text": "tbh you're describing exactly why i stopped chasing the \"AI revolution\" in recruiting last year. spent months testing different platforms that promised autonomous sourcing and... yeah. most just repackage boolean search with a fancy dashboard.\n\nwhat's wild is how many tools call themselves \"generative AI\" when they're literally just running filters. like we tried hireez for a bit because everyone was talking about it, and honestly? it's not generating anything. you feed it requirements, it applies filters and spits out lists. that's not intelligence - that's automated search with extra steps. we found it missed contextual fit constantly, especially for senior roles where nuance matters.\n\nnow i just use it for initial volume when i need bodies fast, then immediately switch to human review. the moment you lean on it for actual judgment you get burned.\n\nwe're staying lean by specializing harder than ever. i tell clients straight up: \"we're not the fastest, but we'll understand your culture better than any algorithm.\" that honest positioning actually converts better than tech promises lately.", "timestamp": "2026-02-15T05:49:18Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Not gonna lie, recruitment in 2026 feels kinda brutal.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1quy94y/not_gonna_lie_recruitment_in_2026_feels_kinda/"}}
