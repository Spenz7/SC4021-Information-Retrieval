I’d want to look at it on a real computer instead of my phone before making a string.\n\nEdit: there’s also a nifty chrome extension called [Data Miner](https://dataminer.io/) that helps you easily scrape web pages. You need a recipe made to scrape what you want from a particular page, but there are some default ones and the LinkedIn X-Ray recipe will port results from a search engine to a spreadsheet pretty decently. Free users get 500 scrapes a month.\n\nFurther Edit: I took a closer look at github.
