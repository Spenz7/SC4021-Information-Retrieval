{"id": "kpxqh3k", "text": "Depends on the role, hiring manager, etc. Some HM’s like more of a role in the early stages, but I always do a calibration exercise and have a few example profiles I’ve sourced that I review with them directly in the intake session. \n\nIt’s a great way to quickly see from the HM’s perspective on what they’re looking for and demonstrate to him/her that you understand the role. Generally I get free rein to pick whatever candidates I deem are good and they’ll take my word for it as I’ve earned their trust by filling roles quickly.\n\nHowever this all goes out the window when we have high volume, I just review applicants, source candidates send them over after filtering things down to the likely best fits and have them confirm their top 3-5 selections and move them into a recruiter screen.\n\nThis helps expedite the hiring process since you’re chatting with people that the HM has already approved, and if they screen well I’ve never had a situation where they didn’t move forward to the next step which is a casual hiring manager interview/screen. \n\nI have 20 full cycle engineering REQs, all one offs and unique skill sets, there’s no damn way I’m going to rely on my surface level understanding of varying engineering backgrounds, when I can eliminate the guesswork and anxiety that who I’m chatting with are the right people by getting the nod of approval from your HM first. \n\nI’ve had a sourcing team at my current and last two companies but I’ve never been impressed with the quality and in my opinion don’t see a ton of value in it if you’re a good full cycle recruiter.
