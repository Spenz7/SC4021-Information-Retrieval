The social rules for interpersonal conversation via remote device are much less formal.  If you want professional and serious candidates then you need to put in a bit more effort than a zoom call. You are representing your company’s values and culture.  If you treat your hiring remote face to face contact as your personal convenience the candidates will also be cavalier with this. Your candidates are also interviewing you and those you represent. Be clear and over communicate. When setting a remote interview be very clear about expectations and ensure those expectations align with your firm’s culture.  The current batch of recent grads lived through COVID and they have developed a remote way to communicate relationships and have not been baptized in corporate cultural practices.

{"id": "nyk7kwa", "text": "I don’t think this is just “early-career candidates aren’t interviewing well.” I think AI and the modern job search ecosystem have completely changed the signal recruiters are used to reading.\n\nBefore AI, a messy interview usually meant inexperience or poor prep. Now, a lot of candidates can show up with a perfectly polished elevator pitch generated by AI, while their real understanding and communication skills don’t match that level. So recruiters see this huge gap between “great intro” and “vague follow-ups” and assume something is wrong with the candidate when really, the tools changed the game.\n\nIt’s also not just ChatGPT. Job boards themselves now promote auto-apply and job copilot tools that blast out applications, generate answers, and coach people on what to say in interviews. That means: Way more candidates per role ,Lower average effort per application ,More people applying to roles they aren’t actually qualified for and more “scripted” answers with weaker real-world grounding\n\nAt the same time, the hiring process itself has burned people out. Endless rounds, ghosting, fake postings, no feedback , after months of that, some candidates stop treating interviews like high-stakes moments. They still want the job, but they’re emotionally disengaged and just trying to survive the process. This means  you end up with three overlapping problems: AI inflating surface-level polish ,Burnout reducing genuine effort, High application volume drowning out strong candidates\n\nThe result isn’t just worse interviews , it’s worse signal. Recruiters are seeing more noise, not necessarily worse people. That’s why I don’t think the fix is “lower expectations” or “complain about Gen Z.” The fix is upgrading how we screen:\n\n\\-Clear expectations for remote interviews (stable setup, no walking on camera, etc.)\n\n\\-Better job descriptions so the right people self-select\n\n\\-Short skills screens or work samples before live interviews\n\n\\-More scenario-based questions instead of purely behavioral storytelling\n\nWhen you tighten the funnel, the quality of the conversations improves fast. You stop wasting time on people who were never a fit, and the good candidates don’t get buried in the noise. So, AI didn’t make candidates worse , it has made old hiring methods less effective.", "timestamp": "2026-01-09T08:07:31Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Junior/Early Career Candidates Just Aren't Interviewing Well...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1q63i3f/juniorearly_career_candidates_just_arent/"}}
