Typically, scammy profiles are of folks with 10 years of experience but only recently created a profile. (Under a year) There are some outliers to this for sure, but most of the time its a correct assumption\n\n-Work on your boolean string searches to capture the right candidates. If you share what you're looking for I can give you a few to try out. \n\n-Set up automation for your scheduling. Use Calendly as you can set up reminders for candidates to help mitigate no shows\n\n-Send them the info they need: Tech stack, Comp, Onsite/remote/hybrid, 1-3 sentences about the company/roles\n\n-Fake applicants: Honestly, I don't post engineering jobs since there are so many fake profiles out there. If you must keep the job posting up, I would advise adding some knock-out questions. \n\nI love recruiting engineers. They're so much fun to talk to.

{"id": "l75cla0", "text": "I’ve been a tech recruiter for a good while, a few tips; \n\n1a- Make sure you completely, profoundly understand what the role/project/tasks are. Solely looking at technos your candidate listed on their profiles does not mean they’re the right fit for your company.\n\n1b- Understand the environment the candidate will be in, so that you can narrow down not only the technologies, but the scale of previous employers, industries, products they worked on (IoT, SaaS, DevOps solutions….) \n\n2- Be personalized in your approach, don’t mass email/inMail unless you know it’s the right move, pique their interest. Usually what does it for me is to be clear about the following; \n- salary / rate expectations\n- their interests (if they listed some)\n- format (contract, perm…)\n- Project/Product/Industry…\n- Why THEM! (a project/responsibility they listed that resonates with what I’m looking for.)\n\n3- If you use LinkedIn Recruiter, use screening/qualification questions, and automate disqualification based on your criteria. (Within the projects features).\n\n4- Accept that you will always receive misaligned applicants, part of the game. Just make sure you use all the tools you have to minimize the volume.\n\n5- When screening them; WHY they’re looking. (Tricky one, just a bump in salary is not a bad reason at all, however their current employer might (will…) counter the offer. So I usually follow up with “did you ask your manager for a raise yet?” / “What did they say?” / “What will you do when you get an offer for X and your boss says Y…”\n\nEdit #1: fixing layout of message.\nEdit #2: adding a few points on #2.

{"id": "l9b59jz", "text": "What you’re experiencing is pretty common, especially in the tech field. Let's figure out what you can do to source quality candidates!  \n  \nFirstly, don’t get discouraged by the ghosting. It happens a lot, even with qualified candidates. Try to set clear expectations about the process and timelines right from the start. Sometimes, candidates are juggling multiple offers and might drop off if they don’t hear back quickly.  \n  \nTo weed out the bots and fake applicants, try adding a few steps in your application process that require personalized responses or tasks. For example, ask candidates to include a specific phrase in their cover letter or answer a couple of questions related to the job. This can help filter out those who are just mass applying.  \n  \nUsing platforms like LinkedIn Recruiter or specialized tech job boards can also help you find more qualified and serious candidates. You can even bring in more genuine applicants by networking within tech communities, attending local meetups, or even hosting your own tech events.  \n  \nLastly, make sure your job postings are clear and detailed about the requirements and what you’re looking for. The more specific you are, the more likely you are to attract candidates who are a good fit.  \n  \nWith time, you will surely find your way as a recruiter!
