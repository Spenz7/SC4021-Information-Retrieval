The resume review woes are what every single recruiter and hiring manager goes through (often to a worse degree, I *wish* I was only getting 100 resumes for roles). For the interview questions, most ATS systems (including Paylocity) will let you create a kit of questions specific to a job, and if they don't you can create your own repository in Google Drive.

Every position should have a job description with the title, location, salary range\\*, exempt/non-exempt, reporting structure, required skills/credentials, essential duties, then the \"preferred\" qualifications.  When a position opens up, you shouldn't need to rewrite a JD, if it is a new position, thinking through who and what you need should take an hour or more. HR should be reviewing JDs to avoid legal pitfalls and conducting a thorough job analysis to update JDs at least annually.  HR or Recruiters can then help you with your employer brand to attract the right candidates and translate the JD to an enticing post.  Paylocity should have the ability to create \"knock-out\" questions of applicants and your HRIS manager will need to help you configure the application.  For example if you are hiring a CPA, a knockout question could be \"are you a licensed CPA in X state?\" and those who answer yes to key qualification questions should rise to the top - quickly allowing you to focus on who is qualified. A good applicant tracking system should be configured to reject unqualified candidates thoughtfully and automatically (as it give it a day or two bro as to not crush egos and your employer brand). Interview questions should be based on the required skills and essential duties of the job.  All applicants for a position should be asked the EXACT same situational and behavior based questions relating to the position and you should be creating interview scorecards on these questions to accurately compare candidates and help eliminate bias.  Keep JDs, Job Posts and Interview Scorecards in the same file not scattered.  Use a spread sheet for scorecards. \\* As for salary ranges - posting them eliminates wasting time on candidates you can't afford.  Someone who has 100% of the required and preferred skills and qualifications is a consultant and will be at the top end of the range.
