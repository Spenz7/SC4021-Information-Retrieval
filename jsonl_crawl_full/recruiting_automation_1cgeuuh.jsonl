{"id": "lyzwsz0", "text": "Revolutionizing Hiring for Executives – The Imperium App is Here! 🚀\n\nHey everyone,\n\nIf you’re tired of the outdated, time-consuming recruiting methods and want something designed for maximum efficiency, you need to check out **The Imperium App**. It’s a **mobile HRIS recruiting platform** that innovates on the 400-year-old, obsolete resume and streamlines the hiring process like never before.\n\nHere’s what makes **Imperium** a game-changer, especially for executive job seekers and employers:\n\n* **The Virtual Resume**: Candidates can create a 90-second video to showcase their personality, skills, and how they can add value—something a traditional resume can’t do. For those who prefer the conventional approach, you can also upload your paper resume, ensuring both options are available to employers.\n* **Standardized Resume Template**: Employers save time searching for relevant information with profiles that are clear, consistent, and easy to evaluate.\n* **LinkedIn Integration**: Candidates can directly import their profile information for seamless setup.\n* **Swipe-to-Match System**: Employers swipe right or left on candidate profiles to accept or decline. Matches show up in the “Matched” tab for easy organization.\n* **Dynamic Candidate Stacks**: If the initial stack of candidates doesn’t meet your needs, use the search function to discover additional stacks that align with your job listing.\n* **Easy Interview Scheduling**: Once you’ve matched with a candidate, they can schedule or reschedule interviews directly through the app. You don’t even need to manage the scheduling—just set your availability in the “Calendar” tab and let interviews come to you.\n* **Virtual Interviews**: Conduct interviews virtually, right from the app, making the process seamless and hassle-free.\n\nHere’s the real kicker:\n\n* On average, **ZipRecruiter charges $24 per applicant**, and **Indeed charges $12 per applicant**, often for candidates who aren’t even qualified.\n* With Imperium, you only pay for candidates you like. **Right swipes cost just $3.5 to $4**, depending on your subscription plan.\n\nTo prevent spam, candidates are limited to **5 right swipes per day**, with additional swipes available for just $1 each.\n\n**The Imperium App is currently available on the iOS App Store**, and I’ve even heard discussions about it coming to the Google Play Store soon.\n\nI truly believe this app can revolutionize hiring and become the **main platform for job recruiting**, replacing the outdated, inefficient methods we’ve been stuck with for years.\n\nWhat do you think? Could this be the future of recruiting?", "timestamp": "2024-11-26T00:34:42Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Recruiting software &amp; tools (agency)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1cgeuuh/recruiting_software_tools_agency/"}}
