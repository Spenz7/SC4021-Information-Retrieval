Going to a place with no brand and team sounds like an exciting opportunity to build but I will tell you it’s not. Unless you’re throwing money like no tomorrow to these people to join your company—especially in the AI space—you’re going to have a really hard time because the top talent will always have options to choose something better than your small startup. Also, working with an exec from the past in a HM capacity is totally different than working with them in founder mode. Because they’ve built the company, founders believe they have to do everything (which is essentially true at this stage of the company you’re considering). What I’m getting at is, you will have a hard time with ownership. I know 3 founding recruiters (4 including myself) that all have had the same experience: founders will micromanage the shit out of you and not let you really own the recruiting process until you can “prove” yourself. All of my network that have been in this role told me they were essentially a sourcer when joining (and same with my experience). It’s a lot of red tape you will have to deal with and a LOT of risk.
