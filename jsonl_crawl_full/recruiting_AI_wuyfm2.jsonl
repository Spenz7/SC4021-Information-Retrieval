The human bias comes in and reads it as say 68%. \n\nThey tend to think, well, not good. The reality is this may be someone that speaks English as a second language, could have a literacy disability, or other legit reason. The AI scored it, but the human bias rejected it. \n\nThe other form of this is bot automation. If you put must have 6 years if experience with a specific coding language, but the person has 5 all within the last 5 years, you can program the interface to reject the resume. Again though, you might identify tiny someone with 6 years experience, but the last time they worked with it was 4 years ago, are they a better candidate?\n\nIt's not so much AI as it is a basic decision tree with no situational logic, (look that term up, it's important).", "timestamp": "2022-08-22T17:01:29Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "How do recruiters feel about implementation of AI into ATS?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/wuyfm2/how_do_recruiters_feel_about_implementation_of_ai/"}}

{"id": "ilcgztx", "text": "The AI itself is pretty useless, but our ATS at least tells us why it thinks a job/candidate are a fit for each other, so we can identify when it’s off if someone bothers to look at it with a little more detail. In practice, most of our recruiters think it’s better to look at the resume and decide than to look at the AI score, look at the resume, and then decide. Either way, they have to look at the resume to determine if the AI did a good job. So it’s mostly a moot point and intellectual exercise.\n\nAlso, outside of search recommendations, our ATS doesn’t allow easy feedback on how the AI did.

{"id": "ile3ods", "text": "It’s a garbage in garbage out feature on its best days. \n\nI have yet to encounter an AI plugin that can perceive that \n1. Sometimes the best candidate isn’t great at writing resumes. \n2. More often the worst candidates are very good at writing resumes. Or not. These two profile types, taken together, probably result in machine unlearning. \n3. Someone can essentially work at the same company for a decade+ that’s gone through various M&amp;A/spin offs etc. does the AI have a data set capturing this? Probably could, very easily, but the goal of vendors hawking these tools is to build something they can sell, and they stop there. Not the greatest AI integration possible.\n4. The people interacting with these programs tend to do so differently. So achieving continuous improvement via continuous use is just going to result in a different garbage in/out variable. \n\nMore often than not, a good recruiter has an intuition developed over time and from fairly complex learnings. For example, we will see a resume come in from “competitor company.” We have possibly been keeping our ear to the ground and know competitor company is in a re-org. So we are less picky about how detailed the resume is, how wordy or catchy it is or is not. This applicant likely has been grinding through said re-org so a good recruiter will look past a less than perfect resume update. This same person has only been with competitor for 4-6 months. Probably a red flag to a machine, but they are missing the human side building along this narrative. \n\nI could go on but I think we get the point. \n\nAlso, for anyone working in an OFCCP regulated environment, AIs are not a substitute for compliant applicant/candidate selection workflows. In this companies, we basically have to review every applicant …. Enough to dispose of them. So the AI is kind of useless. Also, OFCCP companies make up the bulk of really massive, publicly traded corporations. As such, the folks w the most money to spend on vendors have the least to gain from these tools. So they’ll appropriately stay in the minor leagues unless laws change and allow an AI to disposition applications. Which I really hope never happens, somewhat selfishly, as I tend to work at these companies only. Ha. \n\nFinally, it’s important to remember the *only place recruiting/TA is not a cost center is recruiting companies*. I remember a year or two spent at a global tech leader doing Corp level software dev leadership recruiting. I came in expecting all these fantastic cutting edge tools. Big nope. We had three HCM systems that basically didn’t speak to each other, our ATS’s backend was a 20 year old proprietary database that looked like DOS. I remember how my mentor there reacted to my initial shock: “you really think they spend the big bucks on TA? Nah. This is a churn and burn operation, you won’t see many recruiters here who lasted more than 3-4 years.” I immediately felt stupid at how logical and simple his premise was.", "timestamp": "2022-08-23T00:08:27Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "How do recruiters feel about implementation of AI into ATS?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/wuyfm2/how_do_recruiters_feel_about_implementation_of_ai/"}}
