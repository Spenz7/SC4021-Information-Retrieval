{"id": "m1d5cbc", "text": "# 1. User Interface and Experience\n\n* **Workday Recruiter**: The interface is often criticized for being cluttered and unintuitive. Workday prioritizes ERP-style functionality, meaning the recruitment module feels more like an add-on to a larger system rather than a dedicated tool.\n* **Greenhouse**: It was built specifically for recruitment, with a modern, streamlined UI designed for recruiters and hiring managers to move through tasks quickly and easily.\n\n# 2. Customization and Flexibility\n\n* **Workday Recruiter**: Limited customization options. Processes are often rigid and must conform to Workday's structure, which can feel restrictive.\n* **Greenhouse**: Offers more customization for workflows, interview stages, and templates, making it adaptable to different recruitment strategies.\n\n# 3. Candidate Experience\n\n* **Workday Recruiter**: The candidate application process can be cumbersome, requiring multiple steps and account creation. This can deter applicants.\n* **Greenhouse**: Designed with a focus on the candidate experience, offering a smoother and quicker application process.\n\n# 4. Reporting and Analytics\n\n* **Workday Recruiter**: While Workday provides extensive reporting capabilities, setting up reports can be complex, requiring significant configuration and sometimes even external support.\n* **Greenhouse**: Reports are easier to generate and focus on recruitment-specific metrics, giving actionable insights quickly.\n\n# 5. ATS Integration and Features\n\n* **Workday Recruiter**: Integrations with third-party tools can be limited and challenging to implement. Its recruiting features often lack the depth needed for high-volume or specialized hiring.\n* **Greenhouse**: Integrates with many popular recruiting tools (e.g., sourcing, assessments, and background checks) and provides robust functionality for managing recruitment pipelines.\n\n# 6. Speed and Efficiency\n\n* **Workday Recruiter**: Workflows can feel slow and overly administrative, with many clicks required to complete basic tasks.\n* **Greenhouse**: Built for speed, its workflows are optimized to minimize repetitive tasks.\n\n# 7. Focus and Specialization\n\n* **Workday Recruiter**: As part of the larger Workday HCM suite, it aims to support HR processes as a whole rather than excelling in recruitment specifically.\n* **Greenhouse**: A recruitment-first platform, focused entirely on solving challenges specific to talent acquisition.", "timestamp": "2024-12-10T14:48:14Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Corporate Recruiter Using Workday Recruiter - Making me feel like a less than recruiter", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1hal05p/corporate_recruiter_using_workday_recruiter/"}}
