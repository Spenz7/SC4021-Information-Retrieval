To your point it has become exceedingly simple to create resumes that have very little actual content and are just playing the keyword game. \n\nI believe AI can help combat this challenge from the recruiting side if used correctly. I don't agree with passing resumes and a JD to chatGPT and hoping it finds the best match. I have had success with a new software that allows me to create dynamic 'rubrics'. From my understanding the software uses AI to parse and organize the resume data, it doesn't do the matching. Instead they score candidates by using the parsed data and comparing it to the rubrics you create. \n\nSo far I've been very impressed and it's cut down so much time of looking at low quality AI resumes.
