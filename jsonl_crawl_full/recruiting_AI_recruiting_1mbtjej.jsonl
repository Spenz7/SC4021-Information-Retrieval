I saw the boom 2020-2022 and the absolutely depressing mess its been since.

On top of that, I am sure you are like many of us and saw the wall that was hit late 2022/early 2023.   No one talks about the massive tax change that expired that year for R&amp;D.  \n\nI want to preface I absolutely hated the bill passed overall on July 4th by danger yam, but he re-instated section 174 which i think (and many of my partners) was the main reason hiring hit a wall and outsourcing took off.  Most the tech people we recruit fell under this from a tax/finance standpoint and when the tax benefit went away outsourcing became a much better decision financially.
