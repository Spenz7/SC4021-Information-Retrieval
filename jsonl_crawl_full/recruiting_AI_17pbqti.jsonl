{"id": "k84pozs", "text": "No, as far as I know there is NO ATS that reads your resume, and automatically rejects you based on what is or isn't on your resume. And even if you're automatically rejected due to a knockout question, recruiters still have access to your application if they'd like to review it, they're just generally too busy to do so.\n\nThat said, what some ATS's can do is assign you a percentage based on how closely your resume aligns with the keywords in the job description, and recruiters using such an ATS can sort applications based on that percentage. If they get hundreds of applications, they may only have the bandwidth to evaluate the applications listed as being a 90-100% match. Having used iCIMS, which has this feature, I can say that false positives are common, because the ATS is only scanning for keywords, it doesn't understand context like a person can. On the other hand, false negatives, where someone who checks all the important boxes somehow gets a very low percentage, are *very* uncommon. It is likely that you may be a good match and only get, say, an 80% match score, and if there are tons of applications with a better score you might not be seen.\n\nI also want to touch on companies that are so big, and get so many applications, that they have sourcers (yeah, I know, that word looks like \"sorcerer,\" I've only been getting comments like that for *eleven years,* and it stopped being funny eleven years ago) go into the ATS and run Boolean searches to flag the highly qualified candidates, so if your resume doesn't match their searches, it may not be seen.

Quite honestly, they are barely smart enough to scan a resume in and extract the data properly.\n\nWhat does happen is logical scoring based on requirements. Keywords do apply to a certain extent, but primarily in the avenue of tools and topics. From an IT standpoint it might be the identification of languages and the applications used. In real estate you might have a background in titling or VA financing. It is heavily JD driven, but mostly controlled by the user.\n\nThe real scoring does come into play with knockout questions and how they are built. If it is a requirement to have 10 years' experience but you put 9, they may eliminate you, but many offer variable points such as 0-4, 5-9, 10 and over and with each level you are awarded increasing points.\n\nYou might also have a yes/no selection that is absolute. Things like this are always in the JD. Must have experience in x. A \"no\" answer will eliminate you.\n\nAlso from a scoring aspect, we usually identify a threshold. Anybody under a certain amount doesn't get through. This can vary for several factors, number of applicants, the value of the position, etc. My last posting had about fifteen applicants.
