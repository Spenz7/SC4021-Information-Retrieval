As a candidate in the tech industry, as someone coming into the interview with so much emotions running high and having to study and think about my answers and how to present myself, this is a huge insult.

The recruiters effort is the first impression for a candidate of what theyre getting themselves into and for it to begin with pure laziness when we’re expected to be professional is a huge red flag that the company itself is garbage.
