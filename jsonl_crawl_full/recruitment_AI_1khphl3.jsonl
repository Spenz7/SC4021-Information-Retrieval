{"id": "mrf6qxp", "text": "What level of Apollo subscription are you using? And why not use sales navigator instead?\n\nWhat’s the cost for amplify to scrape the lead data from Apollo? \n\nAre you using ChatGPT API to do this?\n\nWhat happens if they don’t accept the connection invite? You can’t send them a message after that. Are you sending them an email message?  How are you doing the second and third follow if they don’t accept your connection request? \n\n\nTip- you can send 50 connect requests a day if you pay for LinkedIn sales navigator. \n\nIf the cost is more than $50 for Apollo, Phantom busters, and anything else besides Make you might wanna look at jobin. The sequencing has “if this then this” \n\nFor example   \n\nStart by sending a connection request if they accept the connection request then you can follow up with a LinkedIn message or just end the sequence and call them or whatever \n\nIf they don’t accept the connection request after let’s say two days and you have their email address you can send  an email. Let’s say two days later and then another one two days later after that. After those two emails that they still haven’t accepted your connection request you can set it up to withdraw the connection request (keeping your connection requests outstanding under 250 to 300 is a good practice. If you have too many outstanding connection request, LinkedIn will smack you on the pee pee) \n\nIf you don’t have an email address for them, you could probably use a web hook and an api key to scrape an email address and then have make automatically put it into the sequencing and then do the email in two days and then email two days after that. \n\n another really awesome thing, in my opinion, about jobin is there chrome extension scrapes an entire search or an entire lead list in sales navigator or LinkedIn recruiter and OG LinkedIn two. For example, if you build a list out in sales navigator, Elly’s list, that has 623 mechanical engineers on it with one click of the chrome extension it will grab every single profile and stick them into jobin. From there, you could send 50 connection request a day, add them to a sequence, even use LinkedIn filters to check to see if any of those people are “open to work“,  first, second or third degree connections, premium, LinkedIn users, or “open workers” (you can send messages to open workers directly. You don’t need to use inmail) \n\nYour system is pretty awesome though. I really like what make it can do and my applicant tracking system has an open API and one of my colleagues has set up a sequence that basically creates a candidate from an interview just using make. \n\nHe records all of his phone calls and then drops the recording into  a Google Drive folder and then from there make transcribes it using whisper, creates a candidate summary, drop that into a new folder, that then tells the applicant tracking system that that’s a candidate, make puts it into the applicant tracking system and fills out the appropriate fields to create a new candidate, attach is the summary as a document, and then boom all done\n\nI’ve worked and played with make, but I’m stupid so it took me two hours just to have it recognized that a file was dropped into a folder and then move it to another folder and I gave up", "timestamp": "2025-05-09T14:05:48Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Automatic AI-Powered LinkedIn Outreach with n8n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1khphl3/automatic_aipowered_linkedin_outreach_with_n8n/"}}
