It's already got all the main features we had in Workable at my previous business. The notetaker is what made it a done deal for me and my TA partner. The feedback we've had after rolling it out is that it has made interviewing easier. Workable worked well enough for the basics, but there are better tools out there so I thought why settle for an \"ok\" tool that isn't really innovating.  \n  \nWe're 95 people and were about 70 when we brought in Screenloop.
