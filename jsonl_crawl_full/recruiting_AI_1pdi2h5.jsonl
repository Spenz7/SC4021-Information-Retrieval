{"id": "ns6qpio", "text": "I am curious what the reasoning for the requirement is for US Citizenship. Secret Clearance and higher will require it. Access to certain military bases / installations may require US citizenship, but it's not super common. In contracts requiring ITAR/EAR compliance, it's required to be a US Person,  but not specifically a US citizen.\n\nAnyway, assuming a clearance is truly required, I'd send another email to candidates who answered that they are citizens to confirm that this position requires ... and due to this, US Citizenship is a job requirement. Do you meet this requirement and have supporting documentation to demonstrate your US citizenship? Maybe add a statement that if they don't answer truthfully, they could be banned from being considered for future positions or tie it into your company values. You could also look for hints on their resume or application. Have they ever lived in the US, did they just go to school in the US. I think I've seen 1 candidate who was actually a US citizen who never lived, worked or studied in the US. However, he had never done any paperwork to document his US Citizenship. No passport, no SSN, etc... so, I still couldn't hire him since I had a deadline to meet.\n\nI also see more and more candidates lie about their Citizenship on their application.  It's so dumb because they are just wasting everyone's time. I don't care how great your experience is. If you're not a US citizen, you can't get a clearance.

{"id": "nw0mnpo", "text": "Ensure your screening question is clear about whether they will require sponsorship *now or in the future,” I've seen some screeners that ask “Are you authorized to work in the United States?” to which F1/OPT applicants can truthfully answer “yes.” Add the follow-up screener, “Will you require sponsorship now or in the future?”\n\nProtip: Consult your HR/Legal team for the best wording here. Also, it’s illegal to discriminate on the basis of national origin, so rejecting candidates on the basis of non-US degrees alone is not a good practice. You could also send a clarifying e-mail to reiterate work authorization when scheduling, or lead with the question in your recruiter screen to ensure the best use of time.
