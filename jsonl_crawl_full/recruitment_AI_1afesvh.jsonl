{"id": "ko9ll22", "text": "Hey, ex tech recruiter. \n\nI played around a lot with GPT 4 when working in recruitment, this is what I found:\n\nIts superpower for recruitment was in summarising, not searching or generating content. \n\nI had a fairly detailed prompt that would take a CV, and summarise it into a few bullet points with key info for me, so I could put that under notes in the ATS - made flicking through way quicker. In my case it summarised a whole CV down to Name, Generic Job Title, Total Years of Experience, Top 3 Primary Skills (typically programming languages in my use case), and 3 x bullet points summarising their professional achievements. \n\nI also had another that would summarise a job posting into the key info I needed at a glance, and was also able to generate a fairly comprehensive boolean search I could copy, that would at least allow me to pull _probably relevant_ candidates from the ATS. \n\nI also had a play around with using it to suggest a list of skills / tags based on a CV, and outputting them as a comma separated list I could paste into the ATS\n\nWhat I ultimately realised is that the searching tools available in recruitment are actually pretty good - certainly good enough to get to a list you can (and should) be reviewing manually. What lets the whole system down is how bad the data input is. You can’t search what isn’t there. CVs don’t have standardised fields or layouts, and almost every CV ingest solution is fairly rubbish beyond basics like extracting emails and phone numbers. \n\nHaving something that properly extracts key information from a CV so that it can be effectively searched later is the real game changer here IMO. \n\nSpeed up the summarising and the searching, and put the time saved into having real conversations with your candidates.", "timestamp": "2024-01-31T11:08:06Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "Can AI find the best candidate from your CV database?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1afesvh/can_ai_find_the_best_candidate_from_your_cv/"}}
