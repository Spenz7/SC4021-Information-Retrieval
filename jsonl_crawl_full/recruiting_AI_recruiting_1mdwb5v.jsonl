You can use AI criteria ranking, Boolean search, keywords, filter by applications answers, etc. I don’t do any app reviews in GH, GH app review sucks ass. The fact you can’t even filter by custom app questions in GH is bonkers. \n\nFor scheduling, we’ve really been enjoying ModernLoop. We used to use GoodTime and it was god awful, we cut our contract early in fact. \n\nRight we’re evaluating Brighthire, metaview, Ashby, Gem (their broader suite, we just use CRM/sourcing/app review products) \n\nFor sourcing, I’d recommend gem or juicebox.ai.

The problem isnt just the software itself but how it handles different types of hiring (especially international + blue collar which is a nightmare)\n\n\n\nwe actually built labourlink because of this exact pain point. main thing we focused on was making it dead simple to use while handling all the complex stuff in the background (visa processing, skill validation etc). our users went from spending 40+ hrs per hire down to about 8-9 hrs which is pretty nuts\n\n\n\nbut if ur just doing standard local white collar recruitment, lever is decent. greenhouse is ok but clunky. if ur doing high volume hiring stay away from both tho, they fall apart real quick when u scale up\n\n\n\nquick tip: whatever system u pick, make sure it can actually export your data easily. got burned by this before, nothing worse than being stuck with a system that holds ur data hostage lol\n\n\n\nalso check if it integrates with whatever else ur using. retrofitting integrations is a massive pain in the ass trust me", "timestamp": "2025-08-22T10:16:35Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Anyone who's truly happy with their hiring software?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1mdwb5v/anyone_whos_truly_happy_with_their_hiring_software/"}}
