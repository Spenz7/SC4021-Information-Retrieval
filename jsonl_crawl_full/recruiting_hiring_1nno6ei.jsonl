We are two generations removed from a time where working class Americans had the basic trades skills necessary to do much beyond the most basic manufacturing jobs. Theres no shortage of bodies, im swimming in applicants. But anything that involves any type of mechanical knowledge...hell, even the ability to simply read a tape measure is often beyond the average participant in our workforce.", "timestamp": "2025-09-24T17:06:58Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Just had a big meeting with a few clients - they are moving away from H1bs", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1nno6ei/just_had_a_big_meeting_with_a_few_clients_they/"}}

{"id": "nfzg2tp", "text": "That's excellent, and long overdue. I know of many highly qualified engineers and computer scientists that have described some of the companies they interviewed with being populated entirely by people from India from the top down and that they would not hire Caucasians. This is going on right now around the country in the USA. Maybe not everywhere and maybe not all the time but the fact that it's happening at all and that Americans who are qualified or being turned down and replaced by people with H1B visas, often getting paid a fraction of what the going rate really would be, is a travesty. \n\nThere is no legal justification to bring somebody from out of the country and pay them less than what an American would be paid. It's just gross.\n\nI certainly hope that this creates a lasting impact and that H1B is not abused as it has been. \n\nSeriously, some of these companies are so overwhelmed by Indian culture that they actually enforce the caste system. It is just gross. In America making American money from American companies, enforcing a sick twisted view of the world that has people called untouchables. Really. They do not deserve to be an America if they have that attitude", "timestamp": "2025-09-24T17:41:08Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Just had a big meeting with a few clients - they are moving away from H1bs", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1nno6ei/just_had_a_big_meeting_with_a_few_clients_they/"}}
