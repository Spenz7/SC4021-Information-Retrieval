Im currently hiring a position and we are using one of the most popular ATS systems. Even when the ATS does not parse things perfectly it’s not hard to figure out when someone is not qualified. We got almost 1k applications for a this job and the sheer volume of absolutely unqualified applicants is creating a ton of noise for us to sift through. So yeah, people need to stop spraying their resume all over jobs they aren’t qualified because it is making things unfair for people who are. Recruiters cannot make you qualified for a job when you’re not. \n\nMore on refining your approach: not applying to jobs that are obvious scams, working with shady recruiters, etc. is one part of that.

I’m trying to think of a compliance requirement that would require roles to be posted externally, but I can’t think of any where it would make sense. \n\nI know the finance industry is highly regulated, I’ve worked in other highly regulated companies like med device and for government/defense contractors, but perhaps finance has other regulations that make this a requirement?", "timestamp": "2023-10-26T10:38:37Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "The Myth of Internal Hires", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/17d19ta/the_myth_of_internal_hires/"}}

{"id": "koxqd7g", "text": "I'd like to share an experience that may sound familiar to a few.\n\nIn 2022, I was in my 2nd year with a company as a contract recruiter. In September of that year, TA Leaders implemented an \"internal candidate first\" approach to address impending layoffs and downsizing. Spubded well intentioned. \n\nWithin a month, we were given lists of employees who were \"flagged\" as going to be let go. They were labeled Priority Candidates. We were asked to put on a career coach hat and help them be placed into new roles. The list grew weekly, and many of these employees had no idea they risked a layoff. Of course, as we made contact with them, obviously, word got around.\n\nBy this time, the procedure for every newly opened position became: post internally for 2 weeks, contact Priority Candidates and ask them to apply, interview every Priority internal who applied, and persuade HMs to hire one of these Prioroty Candidates. We had to report DAILY on every internal we successfully placed, and this was tracked across TA.\n\nHMs knew they were to consider internals. We scheduled interviews, and when HMs didn't find their perfect candidates, they went external. \n\nPressure came down to consider internals who only had 1 or 2 of the requirements. We were asked to consider $140k software developers for $90k customer experience roles. So, HMs sandbagged interviews and waited out the 2 weeks in order to get an external posting approved.\n\nNext, most positions were approved for  'Internal Only'. By the holiday season, all of the departments I suppoted had no external recruitment approved. \n\nIn all of those months I had 17 open roles, only 3 internals were hired. (Iand yet, I was still surprised when my contract was ended in early January 2023.)\n\nI know it's a lot to unpack, but my point is to present an example of how even mandated internal hiring is not the perfect situation.", "timestamp": "2024-02-04T21:47:16Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "The Myth of Internal Hires", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/17d19ta/the_myth_of_internal_hires/"}}
{"id": "koxsi5f", "text": "Yep! Your experience with internals mirrors mine. I do a lot of internal recruitment at my current company, and I see stuff like this all the time. \n\nI’ll send hiring managers internal candidates who are very qualified for the role, have worked for the company for a long time, highly recommended, have experience doing the exact job we are hiring for etc. And managers will still ignore them and hire someone externally! It blows my mind. \n\nWhy hire an unknown external candidate versus a \nProven internal employee.
