The webinar will have hands on sessions and provide an overview of the whole recruitment flow. From creating the job opportunity, to finding the candidate and hiring them.\n\nThe webinar’s outline would be as follows:\n\n- Introduction to ChatGPT and it’s new features for web browsing, image generation, data analysis and more.\n- Practical examples throughout the recruitment process and how each tool could help and save time.\n- Hands-on session with live demonstration and optional follow along\n- Q&amp;A \n\nAnd will provide resources and material that you could use, such as prompt templates, flow pattern and examples, a glossary of terms, and access to a community of other recruiters utilizing AI for their career.\n\nIf this sounds like something you would want to be part of, comment below and I will make sure to make it available for you to RSVP as soon as possible.\n\"\"\"\n\nLet me know what you think!", "timestamp": "2023-10-10T04:33:15Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Leveraging AI in Recruitment", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/174bur9/leveraging_ai_in_recruitment/"}}
