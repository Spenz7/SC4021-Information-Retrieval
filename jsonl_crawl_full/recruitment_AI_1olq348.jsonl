For us, because we were mainly hiring developers, vancit was pretty helpful.

Imagine going trough a 1000 cv's compared to going to 50. That really helped a lot. As well they have a sort of AI coding task, which we used every now and then to evaluate the applicant. This helped us, because normally I used to go to 1 of our developers and ask them to review the given code of the task, as I myself am not too technical.
