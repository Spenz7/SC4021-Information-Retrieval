I notice a lot of candidates refuse to accept the possibility that someone (or many people) might have been a better fit for them.

Government regulations require that a job be posted externally for 3/5/7 days if it’s going to be hired for externally, and a department is creating a role specifically for a certain person (normally somebody who was already working for them as a consultant or on contract). The job is technically already filled, doesn’t need applicants, and doesn’t need advertising, but the rules are black and white. Those ones suck, but there’s almost never a legal way around them (and again, thankfully they’re rare). \n\n2. A job is posted, hiring manager goes through some interviews and realizes that the skills/experience they *thought* they needed actually isn’t what they need. Job is taken down, re-evaluated, and re-posted. This also encompasses compensation misalignment and basic qualifications - if they’re making offers and losing candidates because of comp (either because they set the bar too high or the comp too low), they have to do a bunch of crap on the backend with finance and HR before reposting. \n\n3. This is the most common one I see, but again, still rare: something happens during the hiring process that causes everything to be re-evaluated. Somebody gets promoted, somebody quits or moves to a new team, the department gets more/less budget, a new project comes up that means they’d benefit from hiring a totally different role, any number of things that change the scope and trajectory of the team as a whole can cause the hiring process to fall apart. \n\nAnd none of this is fun for candidates OR the TA team 🙃", "timestamp": "2025-01-17T01:44:51Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Question to corporate recruiters from an agency recruiter about rumored \"ghost jobs\"", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1i2uzee/question_to_corporate_recruiters_from_an_agency/"}}
