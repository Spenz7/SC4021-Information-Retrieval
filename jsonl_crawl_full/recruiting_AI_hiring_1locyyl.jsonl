{"id": "n0vbnvv", "text": "I've tried Metaview, Otter AI, and we are currently using HoneIt. I thought Metaview had the best call summaries. I was able to create templates that gave me exactly the info my hiring managers needed and it pulled it automatically from the conversation. You call Metaview, then dial the candidate. Super easy. I felt Otter Ai was a decent transcription tool but didnt have the customization that was geared towards recruiters. Therefore the summaries were very basic aka here is what was discussed.\n\nThe reason our team is currently using Honeit is because it includes a scheduling feature(which allowed us to get rid of calendly), you can create interview templates that are position specific, and you can create candidate pages to share with your hiring managers(allows them to listen directly to candidate answers). The downside is that Honeit is more of an active process where you need to manually click record on the answers you want on your candidate AI summary. It will record the whole convo but if you don't do the manually recording during the call, you will have to go back afterwards which is just double work. \n\nIf you have any specific questions feel free to reach out directly.", "timestamp": "2025-07-02T01:54:56Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Best AI screening tools?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1locyyl/best_ai_screening_tools/"}}
