Its not the only way and there would be other ways to tackle this as well.\n\nThe challenge you are facing is about Change Management and you can replace it with anything else, covid, change of industry, change of tools, etc.. You are not alone, this is in all industries.\n\nI am assuming you have a well functioning team that trusts one another and care about each other.\n\n**First step** is to create a open forum where people can share their thoughts on exactly this with the team.  \nThe objective for this is to give space to the team to share:\n\n* how everyone is feeling about it (including yourself), encourage respectable open discussion in a safe space where can be vulnerable enough to share.\n* what their thoughts are \n* what are their concerns (You can have an activity. where you can categorise what is in your/our control and what isnt?) Hint. No one in this world can do anything about things they can't control, you can choose how to react to it. if it is in your control then do something about it.\n* what opportunities do they see, (what excites them? what is in your/our control/)\n* what would make them at ease (motivated and feeling secure)\n* Create a practical achievable action plan.\n\n**Second** Implement the plan, this is crucial and will take time and resources. Only do step one if you are prepared to implement the action plan. nothing worse than having all the discussion and then it gets lost in BAU activities.\n\n**Third** have a check in session in 2-3 months to see what progress has been made and how is everyone feeling.\n\nIn times of uncertainity, people wanna feel heard, people wanna know that they are not alone in feeling the same, if they can see something good coming out of it and there is a plan to get there then you can get security and feel motivated. A leader who can show hope and light at the end of the tunnel is critical\n\nYou can reflect on how you would have navigated as a team through Covid and you will go through this together.\n\nThe only thing constant is change.  \n\n\nHope this is somewhat helpful.
