{"id": "n7xd2zg", "text": "Honestly this is exactly why the “screen everyone, hope for the best” model feels so broken right now. The tools are there for candidates to fake polish, and the more generic the sourcing, the more you’ll end up with people who can play the game rather than people who can actually do the work.\n\nIf we keep relying on static resumes and cold outreach, this is just going to get worse. You’re not learning anything new about a candidate in that first call... you’re just giving them a stage to recite a prepped monologue (human or AI-generated).\n\nI’ve found the only real antidote is starting with more context before you even talk to them. Actual insight into what they’ve been doing, learning, and engaging with recently makes it way harder for someone to fake fit. When you know the “now” and not just the “past”, it changes the conversation completely.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10T11:50:10Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "AI in an Interview Today", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1miu768/ai_in_an_interview_today/"}}
{"id": "n7zwjmk", "text": "I'm sorry if I cannot respond like this, but here goes.  I know this post is not overreacting to someone using Ai to get ahead in an interview.  I agree, it sucks. But. Every tech company and start up and dude in his basement is trying to sell us Ai. Probably that same tech company is too.  Ai for start ups, AI for recipes, AI for enterprise and Ai for mom pop shops to solve all your problems.  Don't get me wrong they work too.  The job market is a gauntlet of judgment, self doubt, rejection, and behind it all the deep seeded fear of losing everything.  Is any company not going to use Ai to get ahead and make money?  Are they going to not fire people because they are being replaced by llms because it's just not fair? So any interviewers and recruiters, especially from the tech industry, stop clutching your pearls.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10T20:18:02Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "AI in an Interview Today", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1miu768/ai_in_an_interview_today/"}}

{"id": "nzwsgno", "text": "I had this odd experience in a second (and final) interview for a non-tech role. I was given an hour to complete a task and put together a training module on a specific legal and political topic. Lots of material to read through and the time was very tight - that was the point. To see how I would handle gathering info under time pressure and what I did with it.\n\nI was given an hour alone in the meeting room, and the interviewer (who would have been my direct boss), said he'd be back shortly before the hour was up, to giver me the heads up that the rest of the team, his boss, his boss's boss and some political people (it was a government role) would be trooping in shortly to hear my presentation. They gave me a laptop of theirs to use with all the material on it.\n\nAfter a half hour, a knock at the door and the interviewer walks in really fast and peers at my screen. \"How are you getting along?\" I said \"Fine - it's a lot of material, but I'm on it and it'll be done on time.\n\nThen he looked at me and said \"I'm going to be honest: I wanted to see if you were using AI for this task, as other candidates did that.\" I laughed and said \"Why would I do that? I have a brain.\" He grinned and offered to bring me a coffee, which was nice.\n\nI ended up not getting the job, because the other candidate had some very specific experience that gave them the edge. \n\nBut the interviewer spent a half hour on the phone with me, telling me that he really liked my work and if it had been up to him alone (and to the rest of the team), they would have taken me. And we had a chat about the role and so on. And he even offered that I could use him as a reference if I applied to another role in the department.\n\nBut I thought it was funny that others had tried to cheat with AI on that task. lol...", "timestamp": "2026-01-16T12:42:01Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "AI in an Interview Today", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1miu768/ai_in_an_interview_today/"}}
