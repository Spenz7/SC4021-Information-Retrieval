{"id": "ne2nj5h", "text": "Gem’s AI features are overhyped in my experience. I demoed with them at the start of 2025 as an existing user. It was so bad that nobody on the team endorsed using it for applicant review when we piloted it and gave them access. Gem is also not as good at implementation and customer success as I would’ve liked. I am sure they have good reps, but they aren’t all good is my point. Admittedly they’re great at contract negotiations and likely to give you a good price year one and not be super unreasonable year 2.\n\nWhat’s more, their Chrome extension workflow and csv upload methods to get candidates into the CRM portion of their ecosystem are considerably slower with worse UI and more clicks per candidate than Ashby. \n\nI am not saying don’t buy Gem. But understand that Gem was created as a sourcing companion to go with LinkedIn. Their growth is admirable. They’re pushing on the right features. But I really didn’t find the value to be there on the AI side. And their ATS is basically entirely new and may have gaps around integrations and advanced features. \n\nFor equivalent quality AI feature, I’d look at Dover or Covey. Both are looking to sell you on AI sourcing and Dover at least has very low ATS costs. I know less about Covey as I only demoed and didn’t pilot. Neither is as robust an ecosystem as Ashby. I found both product’s AI resume review to be every bit as good as Gem’s, and I demoed their tools in 2024 - they may have gotten even better since. In fairness, same may be true for Gem.\n\nI personally would spend the time to get the contract you need with Ashby as others here are suggesting. Ashby is doing a very good job growing with their user base in every area of the business except pricing - and it’s allowing them to move upmarket well. They will make a more compelling ATS for a 500 person company than Gem, Dover, or Covey IMHO. But all of them are startups. It’s just my guess that Ashby will move upmarket the best of the three. \n\nYou probably know this already, but migrating is itself a pain. It will slow you down and cost the business time instead of money. If you aren’t happy with other aspects of Ashby’s feature set - totally pull the plug. But if it’s just a pricing issue, I’d consider the incremental cost of re-allocating seats or paying the higher amount to probably be offset by the labor and efficiency loss of moving.", "timestamp": "2025-09-13T22:50:45Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Ashby Alternatives - new pricing structure stinks (or experience w Gem's ATS)?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1ng6kan/ashby_alternatives_new_pricing_structure_stinks/"}}
