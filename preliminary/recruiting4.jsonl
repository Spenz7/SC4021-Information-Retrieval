{"id": "njyjaes", "text": "Marketing , Sales, Product Development , name the function and AI is transforming it ! Why should HR fall behind? I have always been tech savvy and hence OBVIOUSLY leaned towards AI usage in recruitment.   \n  \nSince I have been trying out different tools and workflows over the past few months realized how it drastically takes out monotony from hiring especially the screening bit which we all know eats up SO MUCH time. \n\nHeavy lifting, resume parsing, filtering all can be taken care of by AI while you simply define the process &amp; needs. You don't have to replace your judgement with AI but actually use it to solidify your decision.  \n\nReducing noise in the pipeline and finding the right talent  was such a toil until I found this user friendly tool ZipRecruiter. Based on engagement patterns, job requirements , past successful hires it surfaced relevant candidates for me and I could fill in the role with faster than I ever did!  \nWhat's been your biggest win using AI in HR ?
