{"id": "mj1c9km", "text": "AI’s been a huge unlock across the recruiting flow with many people I work with. I’ve seen folks use it effectively for everything from sourcing and outreach to note-taking, scheduling, and even initial screening.\n\nFor sourcing, tools like Hireflow or Lazy apply AI to find and prioritize top-of-funnel candidates. For outreach, ChatGPT helps write more tailored emails that actually get responses, especially when paired with enrichment tools like Clay or Apollo.\n\nNote-taking is another low-hanging fruit: Fireflies or [Otter.ai](http://Otter.ai) are great for automatically summarizing calls and syncing notes to your ATS.\n\nThere are also newer tools now that take it a step further &amp; do most things with AI. [Promap](https://www.promap.ai), for example, sources (searches LinkedIn &amp; other places for best fit candidates and gives you a list), filters inbound resumes and runs voice-based interviews to assess candidates, then generates a ranked shortlist. It’s especially helpful for startups or lean teams that don’t have time to manually screen dozens of candidates or interview for roles they’re not deeply familiar with.\n\nMore mainstream ATS' like Ashby &amp; Greenhouse are also not using AI to do resume filtering. It really depends on where you want to get efficiency gains.", "timestamp": "2025-03-21T20:32:25Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Recruiters and AI", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1jfeum2/recruiters_and_ai/"}}
