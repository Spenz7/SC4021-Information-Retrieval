{"id": "nmo8431", "text": "AI screening is where i've seen the most impact - we use it at Top Funnel Talent for initial resume parsing and it catches things humans miss. Like when someone lists \"React\" in their skills but never mentions it in their work experience.. the AI flags that stuff immediately. Saves probably 2-3 hours per role just on the first pass.\n\nThe scheduling AI though? Total waste. We tried 3 different tools and they all broke when candidates had complex availability or wanted to reschedule. Ended up going back to having a human coordinator because fixing the AI mistakes took longer than just doing it manually. Interview AI is cool for note-taking but the transcripts are still wonky with technical terms - had one that kept writing \"Python\" as \"pie thon\" for an entire interview.", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T08:16:32Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Anyone actually cut hiring costs using AI recruiting tools at scale?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1ol29y8/anyone_actually_cut_hiring_costs_using_ai/"}}

{"id": "nmv06jl", "text": "My cousin works at a popular IT firm, and they have this agentic software called Hyreo, which has cut down hiring costs by 30% or something.\n\nI came to know more about AI agents in hiring from him. The tool offers different services. For example, if you want to improve candidate engagement, they have Engage X,  which uses agent-led communication 24/7. If you're worried about post-offer candidate ghosting, they have Convert X (onboarding automation + ticketing support + engagement + joiner propensity predictions).\n\nAnd if you want everything to be run by AI agents from sourcing to onboarding, with occasional human intervention, they have an agentic ATS setup as well.\n\nIf you really want to know the ROI with this tool, you can check it out using their ROI calculator. I think it's on their website.", "timestamp": "2025-11-03T11:11:34Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "recruiting", "post_title": "Anyone actually cut hiring costs using AI recruiting tools at scale?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/1ol29y8/anyone_actually_cut_hiring_costs_using_ai/"}}
