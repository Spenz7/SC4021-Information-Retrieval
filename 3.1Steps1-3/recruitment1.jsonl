If you’re one of those companies that does a lot of contract and staffing and you get hundreds of resumes every time you post a job ad,   It can take and filter out the obvious unqualified candidates. But beyond that, I think we’re still very far away from it having any real value.\n\nAnd I don’t see it replacing the soft skills anytime soon. That’s something we’re always going to need in our industry.\n\nAnd then there’s really lots of different AI when it comes to the recruiting industry. For example, my applicant tracking system, Loxo, has a AI that helps rate candidates from their sourcing platform as well as candidates you have inside your database againstt job descriptions when you add a job to your pipeline. \n\nI would say it works OK. But it’s not groundbreaking or anything like that. It often misses qualified candidates or rates some candidates as “perfect fits” and they’re not. \n\nAnd then you have the AI transcription services for video meetings and calls. I really like those. I record all my phone calls and all my video meetings and then have the transcript summarized, for example interview notes that I can send to a client or job intake so I can focus more on talking to the employer and not taking notes myself. \n\nThere are a lot of use cases for AI, but people have to be careful not to get caught up in the “weapons of mass distraction” that can happen in today’s crazy AI environment", "timestamp": "2025-03-29T13:42:10Z", "source": "reddit", "metadata": {"subreddit": "Recruitment", "post_title": "AI in Hiring tools - Yes or No?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Recruitment/comments/1jmizg8/ai_in_hiring_tools_yes_or_no/"}}

{"id": "n3ptnax", "text": "Just like most answers here, AI should be used to HELP the recruiter NOT REPLACE him/her. In today’s job market, you have to use AI if you want to stay ahead and keep up with the fast-growing tech industry. It’s also good to organize your work and manage the workload; like some people mentioned here, there are useful tools for note-taking, scheduling, writing JDs etc. So it’s only rational to use AI for these administrative tasks. But what I don’t agree with is to use it for qualifying/interviewing candidates. Because it’s not only disrespectful and unfair to candidates, it can be counterproductive as it may disqualify great candidates. And it can also harm company’s reputation cuz lots of candidates actually hate these AI tools, so if a candidate attends an itv and sees that it’s actually an AI recruiter is the one interviewing them, they will definitely not apply again for that company.
